It wasn't until when I was buying plane tickets and changing the default "round-trip" to "one-way," that it occurred to me: I was leaving for good. It would be four whole years before I'd get back again. (Unless I graduate early LMAO.)

To the United States, where people eat broccoli raw (and complain that it tastes bad) and pack peas inside bags to put on their forehead when they have a fever.

This is pretty much the first time I've traveled alone so far away. I'm ready to make a Twilight Sparkle-style checklist of all the things I need to do. How do I find my transfer plane? Or which conveyor belt my luggage went to? How to check them in again at San Francisco? What if I fuck up and got stranded in, IDK, Detroit?? What if they send me back at the customs? What if I ran into an emergency and had to call my parents but they're asleep and didn't answer?

I'd much rather cuddle in my mom's lap forever but I know that one day I'm going to have to live without them, whether because I've grown up or we're separated by another kind of one-way ticket. I'd much rather go through the former first. At least I can call them and message them, and they can come over during the summer. They even had instructions for me to rent a small place with one bedroom so they can sleep in the bedroom while I can fuck off on the sofa or something, provided that there *is* a sofa. I need to rent a place regardless; the dorms close during the holidays. Like c'mon, why? My parents aren't letting me go back during the summer either, because "all they do is lie in their beds and waste their lives when they could've been doing internships or taking courses."

But like, who doesn't want to lie in her bed all day?
