<h1>Chinese culture revolves around stupid puns</h1>
<p>I was thinking recently about how Chinese culture kind of revolves around stupid puns<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Why can't you gift someone clocks or cups? Because puns. &quot;Gifting clocks&quot; (送钟 sòng zhōng) sounds identical to &quot;hosting a funeral&quot;(送终 sòng zhōng). By extension, you can't gift anything that lets you read the time either, like watches. &quot;Cups&quot; (杯具 bēi jù) sounds identical to &quot;tragedy&quot; (悲剧 bēi jù) so yeah, cups are also bad.</p>
<p>What's really funny to me personally, after I learned it, is how you can't cut your hair in January<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> because your uncle would die.</p>
<p>This is long-winded. Bear with me.</p>
<p>So in the Qing dynasty men had to do their hair into a silly little braid, which was stupid. Imagine being a guy and being legally obliged to braid your hair. I'd just unalive myself. Actually you know what, I li Anyways, the hairstyle also entailed shaving the top of your head bald. And if you don't shave it every once in a while your hair would grow back (surprise) and you'd get in jail or something.</p>
<p>Now obviously people hated this, not only because it was stupid but also in Confucian culture you're not supposed to cut your hair because it came from your parents<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>. So there birthed a tradition that people won't shave their hair in January, because &quot;nostalgia&quot; (思旧 sī jiù).</p>
<p>And the thing spread by word-of-mouth, and then some idiot heard this and went like &quot;Oh? Dead uncle? (死舅 sǐ jiù)&quot;</p>
<p>So now everyone believes that if you cut your hair in January, your uncle would die. In fact, a lot of barbershops don't even open during that month, because no one would come anyways.</p>
<p>It would've been just an interesting tradition if it weren't for some batshit crazy people.</p>
<p>It was new year 2024, and this guy went for a haircut in a barbershop that was open for some reason.</p>
<p>In the same evening, his uncle died in a car crash.</p>
<p>That wasn't the funny part<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. The funny part was that his aunt sued him for murder. Her husband died <em>because</em> her nephew got that haircut!</p>
<p>That thing hit the headlines for a while. It was just so fucking funny. Imagine you're a judge and some lady wants her nephew executed for getting a haircut. I'd quit my job.</p>
<p>And then there were those ancient classic stupid puns we had to <em>learn</em> in elementary school. Google tells me they're either called &quot;idioms&quot; which isn't that accurate a name, or &quot;truncated witticisms&quot; which I don't even know what the heck that means. They come in two parts, the first one describing something and the second offering an explanation of the first part — with a pun in there. In elementary school we had those kinds of questions where they put a bunch of first parts and second parts in two columns and we had to match them.</p>
<p>The most classic example would be the nephew one<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. It goes like this: &quot;Nephew lights a lantern — to shine on his uncle.&quot; It's logical right, if you light a light you wanna light something up. If a nephew does it, it would be to his uncle. The pun comes in the second part, 照舅 (zhào jiù), which sounds identical to &quot;same as usual&quot; (照旧 zhào jiù). So by saying this, you're saying someone just did the same thing they always did with no change in their behavior.</p>
<p>It's not really limited to old ones. People make new ones all the time too. I remember this one that went like &quot;Anhui gets bombed — Wuhu goes flying.&quot; Wuhu is a city in Anhui province. If Anhui gets bombed, everything inside would get blown away physically, which includes Wuhu city. Wuhu also sounds similar to &quot;woohoo,&quot; and this paired with &quot;goes flying&quot; would mean something like &quot;I'm really happy.&quot; Which is stupid and funny.</p>
<p>So anyways that concludes this stupid little post about puns.</p>
