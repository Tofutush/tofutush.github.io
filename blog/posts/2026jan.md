Here comes the first installment of me disciplining myself into writing monthly recaps. I need a template for this thing.

## How was the month?

Cold. Snow everywhere. For the first part, winter break wasn't over, and I was honestly quite bored. And then I got back to school and reunited with more friends. And then it started to snow a ton and that got classes all canceled.

When I got back to the dorm, I unpacked, and swept the entire place. It was not big but I still got so tired that my stomach started growling like crazy.

## Milestones

- I spent a whole year being eligible for the death penalty, yet not being sentenced to death.
- I started the second semester of college, despite not having any classes due to the snow.

## Stuff I did

- Wrote a couple chapters of [Spy School](https://tofutush.neocities.org/stories/spy-school/chapter-1/).
- Made a [writing system](https://tofutush.neocities.org/world/alphabet/).
- Wrote a quiz framework and published [quizzes](https://tofutush.neocities.org/fun/superpower-quiz/).
- Made a [tilde.town page](https://tilde.town/~tofutush).
- Made a [microblog](/pages/microblog).
- Started the Tadlet Kingdom Adventures project.

## Stuff I want to do

- Continue doing the Tadlet Kingdom Adventures project.
- Do well at school.
- Reread the *Wings of Fire* books to prepare for book 16.
