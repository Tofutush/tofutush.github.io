List of travel destinations that I have gone to, or want to go! Listed in no particular order; wishlisted for no particular reason other than a simple desire to just *go*.

It would be a long while before I'd actually get to travel anywhere but well, it's good to have one of these stuff here.

- China
	- [x] Shenzhen: I live here. (Not anymore.) 0/10 don't recommend. Rains whenever you want to go out and the sun comes out only when you're at home. Humidity can reach 90%. Home to the worst high school in all of human existence.
	- [x] Hong Kong: Never really as a tourist, just there to do stuff like get vaccines
	- [x] Hunan: Never really as a tourist, just there to visit my dad's hometown. 0/10 new years suck and nothing is ever not spicy and they never give red packets more than 500 yuan so what's the point
	- [x] Hebei: Never really as a tourist, just there to visit my mom's hometown. 10/10 my aunts make great food
	- Yunnan
		- [x] Kunming
		- [x] Dali
		- [ ] Lijiang
		- [ ] Shangri-la
	- Xinjiang (11/10 if you ignore the aridness and the bugs and the horse poop)
		- [x] North
			- [x] Urumqi
			- [x] Altay
			- [x] Ili
		- [ ] South
			- [ ] Kashgar
			- [ ] Aksu
			- [ ] Hotan
	- [ ] Inner Mongolia
	- [ ] Tibet (better before I get old)
	- [ ] Qinghai
- [x] United States
	- [x] The west coast, mostly.
