title: Scrapped story arcs, or, how TIR developed
---

The very first story of TIR is [Coastline Middle School Mysteries](https://tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll/stories/cms-mysteries/), but there was one before it called Hillslope Mysteries.

If you had been on my site for longer, you might have seen that story tucked in the last page of the stories page; or you might even remember the time when the comic was front and center, the first thing you see when opening my site. But now I had removed it entirely because it was old and cringe and scrapped anyways.

It was because TIR started as a Homestuck fanventure featuring my OC, whose name is… you guessed it… Sparky. Full name Sparky Donuts, indigoblood.
