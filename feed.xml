    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Warning: this post is a little vent-y)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a little about the dormmate I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She used to be from another fancy private school&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/dormmate-drama.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but transferred here at the start of 12th grade. Which is technically impossible, transferring from a private school to a public one. I don&#39;t know how she -- more specifically, her parents -- did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also get random new dorms each school year, so just by chance, I got lumped in with her. There were supposed to be 4 people, but only 3 really stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t beef with my dormmates. We usually get along well. But not her. She was spoiled rotten -- guess I should&#39;ve expected it. Her parents could get her transferred to a public school, after all. But the thing is, I &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; mind. I don&#39;t mind her personal lifestyle habits; I don&#39;t mind if she has to take 30-min long showers and blow her hair for an additional 20; I don&#39;t mind if she had to sleep through the first period; I don&#39;t mind if she has to use 2 desks to put all her stuff, since there were only 3 people anyways so we had a spare desk. I &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; mind any of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; mind, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, is her blatant disrespect for everybody else. It was like she thought she was the main character and everyone else is an NPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got along for a while. But there were signs. The most obvious one was the card thing. We had to use our school cards to swipe the dorm door open. One day, I was inside and heard knocking, so I opened the door. She was outside and went in. I asked her, in a chitchat manner, &amp;quot;forgot your card?&amp;quot; And she replied, &amp;quot;no, it&#39;s in my bag, it&#39;s just too much trouble to take it out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many things wrong with this interaction I don&#39;t even know where to start. She legit thought it was okay to trouble other people to avoid troubling herself. And the fact that she &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; it out loud, to my face, proves that she &lt;em&gt;did not even think that was wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m convinced that to this day, as I&#39;m writing this post, she still thinks that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am the asshole for not even wanting to do the extremely simple task of opening the door at her bidding -- can&#39;t Tofu &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; how hard it is for me to take the card out of my bag??/s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By the way, we use our cards to buy food too -- would be a shame if she starved because she could not get her card out of her bag.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the first time. On the second time, after asking &amp;quot;forgot your card?&amp;quot; and receiving a similar answer again, I got pissed and said, &amp;quot;I&#39;m just a servant to you, right?&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/dormmate-drama.html#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;quot; Upon hearing that, she slammed the door -- which was nice, actually; she loves leaving the door open behind her until someone else (usually me) goes to close it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know her exact age but she couldn&#39;t have been younger than 17. We&#39;re nearly adults. She still acts like a literal spoiled baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, my servant statement was the breaking point for her. Yeah, an off-handed, casual half-insult. During later arguments she would constantly bring that line up and go &amp;quot;how are you a servant? How come I think you&#39;re my servant?&amp;quot; or something like that, probably thinking she actually had a coherent argument, or anything better she could nitpick about my behavior. Again, like a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breaking point for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, however, was the trash can thing. So our dorms don&#39;t have trash cans in them; we had to bring our own. But most of the time, there were cans left by the previous inhabitants of the dorm. Not this time though. So I brought a trash can here, along with trash bags, for us three to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; rule: if it&#39;s empty, put a bag in it. The bags are here. Right here, for everyone to take. Grab one. Put it in the can. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; throw trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She kept on throwing trash into a bare can. I talked to her. I told her, the bags are right there, put one in! She could take none of it. I didn&#39;t throw wet stuff! Those are all dry stuff that wouldn&#39;t stick to the can! What&#39;s wrong with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Km km. It is my trash can; you can follow my &lt;em&gt;one and only rule&lt;/em&gt; or I could just &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; let you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put the can on my table. It&#39;s mine now. Neither of you gets to use it. Actually I would&#39;ve let the third girl use it anyways since &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; didn&#39;t do anything wrong, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the maddening thing: she &lt;strong&gt;still threw stuff into the can anyways&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Not only behind my back, but also right in front of me, even!&lt;/strong&gt; She walked over to me desk, threw some shit in, muttering &amp;quot;I&#39;ll borrow this for a bit, thank you&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/dormmate-drama.html#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I carved her face out, my family won&#39;t have to buy extra food for a month. That&#39;s how thick her skin is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heated arguments; the dorm manager got involved; she was yelling, screaming incoherent bullshit -- clearly on the defensive, which worked, since neither me nor the dorm manager could get a word in; and when she finally allowed our input she would cut into our speech about three characters in. The funniest thing was once she mentioned how I was constantly getting in fights with other dormmates, even before she shared a dorm with me -- the third girl told her that! Which was funny on so many levels. She was the &amp;quot;new kid&amp;quot; and she dared talk about my past in front of the dorm manager, who had known me for two previous years? In addition, this was my first time sharing a dorm with the third girl too. This convinced me even more that she thinks we&#39;re all NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long while, even just thinking about her made my blood boil. Fortunately, sometimes she goes home to sleep. Unfortunately, it means every night is a surprise of &amp;quot;will she be here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something had to change. I used to think that there&#39;s only one semester left, so I could roll with it; and if I quit, or moved to another dorm, it would be me losing. She&#39;d win, and I&#39;d lose. Looking back, that was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; childish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I decided to move. There was an empty spot in a dorm full of my friends, so I moved there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of physical problems in that dorm. The door can&#39;t be closed properly and water keeps leaking out from mysterious places. But I am &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;. I am with my friends! I started looking forward to each night, instead of dreading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you&#39;ll excuse me sounding like a sloppy old cartoon moral narrator: sometimes we get in situations that make us uncomfortable and we just go with it, thinking we could handle it. Maybe its annoying dormmates, or maybe it could be a relationship we no longer wanna be in, etc. Move the hell out. There&#39;s got to be somewhere we can move to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, my longest post yet, a vent post. Venting sure is the muse of inspiration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot;&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we started high school there was a kid on the roll-call, but she never attended, and we were told she decided to go to some private school. They had the same surname but I couldn&#39;t remember the girl&#39;s full name, so I couldn&#39;t make assumptions. But if they were indeed the same person, then she didn&#39;t technically transfer here I guess. She was supposed to be here in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/dormmate-drama.html#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;我就是来伺候你的是不？ &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/dormmate-drama.html#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;借扔一下谢谢 &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/dormmate-drama.html#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I&#39;m learning to drive!</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/im-learning-to-drive.html" />
    <updated>2025-03-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/im-learning-to-drive.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Look I know I&#39;m still owing the Counterfeit Monkey and Spider and Web posts, but I wanna talk about my first driving lesson right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coach thought I had been practicing for a long time, and he was surprised when I told him this was my first time touching a steering wheel. I did mistake the gas for the brake and the brake for the gas each once though, and on another occasion forgot to brake when going down a slope, but overall I think I did well! I hit zero people, zero cars, and zero walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main task is just to learn how to drive, instead of passing the test, because even if I got a license in China I&#39;d still have to take another test in the US. But if I got a license in the US I&#39;d be able to change it into a Chinese license. And the test in the US is insanely easy. My mom got a license there, and changed it when we got back in China. She could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; drive I tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of my mom, I also had to convince her yet again that there were peas in the US. This was not the first time we had this conversation. She was getting old.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese Culture Revolves Around Stupid Puns</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html" />
    <updated>2024-12-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was thinking recently about how Chinese culture kind of revolves around stupid puns&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&#39;t you gift someone clocks or cups? Because puns. &amp;quot;Gifting clocks&amp;quot; (送钟 song4 zhong1) sounds identical to &amp;quot;hosting a funeral&amp;quot;(送终 song4 zhong1). By extension, you can&#39;t gift anything that lets you read the time either, like watches. &amp;quot;Cups&amp;quot; (杯具 bei1 ju4) sounds identical to &amp;quot;tragedy&amp;quot; (悲剧 bei1 ju4) so yeah, cups are also bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s really funny to me personally, after I learned it, is how you can&#39;t cut your hair in January&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; because your uncle would die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is long-winded. Bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the Qing dynasty men had to do their hair into a silly little braid, which was stupid. Imagine being a guy and being legally obliged to braid your hair. I&#39;d just unalive myself. Anyways, the hairstyle also entailed shaving the top of your head bald. And if you don&#39;t shave it every once in a while your hair would grow back (surprise) and you&#39;d get in jail or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now obviously people hated this, not only because it was stupid but also in Confucian culture you&#39;re not supposed to cut your hair because it came from your parents&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So there birthed a tradition that people won&#39;t shave their hair in January, because &amp;quot;nostalgia&amp;quot; (思旧 si1 jiu4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thing spread by word-of-mouth, and then some idiot heard this and went like &amp;quot;Oh? Dead uncle? (死舅 si3 jiu4)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now everyone believes that if you cut your hair in January, your uncle would die. In fact, a lot of barbershops don&#39;t even open during that month, because no one would come anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would&#39;ve been just an interesting tradition if it weren&#39;t for some batshit crazy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was new year 2024, and this guy went for a haircut in a barbershop that was open for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same evening, his uncle died in a car crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn&#39;t the funny part&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The funny part was that his aunt sued him for murder. Her husband died &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; her nephew got that haircut!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thing hit the headlines for a while. It was just so fucking funny. Imagine you&#39;re a judge and some lady wants her nephew executed for getting a haircut. I&#39;d quit my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were those ancient classic stupid puns we had to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; in elementary school. Google tells me they&#39;re either called &amp;quot;idioms&amp;quot; which isn&#39;t that accurate a name, or &amp;quot;truncated witticisms&amp;quot; which I don&#39;t even know what the heck that means. They come in two parts, the first one describing something and the second offering an explanation of the first part -- with a pun in there. In elementary school we had those kinds of questions where they put a bunch of first parts and second parts in two columns and we had to match them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most classic example would be the nephew one&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It goes like this: &amp;quot;Nephew lights a lantern -- to shine on his uncle.&amp;quot; It&#39;s logical right, if you light a light you wanna light something up. If a nephew does it, it would be to his uncle. The pun comes in the second part, 照舅 (zhao4 jiu4), which sounds identical to &amp;quot;same as usual&amp;quot; (照旧 zhao4 jiu4). So by saying this, you&#39;re saying someone just did the same thing they always did with no change in their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not really limited to old ones. People make new ones all the time too. I remember this one that went like &amp;quot;Anhui gets bombed -- Wuhu goes flying.&amp;quot; Wuhu is a city in Anhui province. If Anhui gets bombed, everything inside would get blown away physically, which includes Wuhu city. Wuhu also sounds similar to &amp;quot;woohoo,&amp;quot; and this paired with &amp;quot;goes flying&amp;quot; would mean something like &amp;quot;I&#39;m really happy.&amp;quot; Which is stupid and funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyways that concludes this stupid little post about puns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do I say &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; puns&amp;quot;? Because all puns are ontologically stupid. No matter how clever the pun is it&#39;s still stupid. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techinally 正月 (zheng1 yue4), the first month on the Chinese calendar. But whatever. The fault lies in you weird people making up silly names for months. Imagine being a month named &amp;quot;May.&amp;quot; I&#39;d just unalive myself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they happily cut their nails. Don&#39;t your nails also come from your parents? Hypocrites. Have I ever told you Confucian culture was ontologically hypocritical? Now I have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;People dying ain&#39;t funny. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is it with nephews and uncles all over the place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/chinese-culture-revolves-around-stupid-puns.html#fnref5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Uh to start it off, Counterfeit Monkey is an interactive fiction by Emily Short. It&#39;s a great game. I can&#39;t finish it without hints but it&#39;s a great game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started playing it a second time and hoping I won&#39;t need to use as many hints now that I&#39;m more familiar with the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m definitely gonna write something more than this later. And another one on Spider and Web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thanos Snap</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/thanos-snap.html" />
    <updated>2024-10-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/thanos-snap.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or, Achilles chases the turtle but genocide instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine today said as an exasperated joke, &amp;quot;I am Thanos and I would snap two times and kill everyone!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was like, &amp;quot;Well actually you can only kill 75%. Because after you snapped once, only half were left, and if you snap again you can only kill a fourth.&amp;quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/thanos-snap.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that logic, Thanos can never kill everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that he can, because you can&#39;t split one person into infinitely small pieces. When there&#39;s one last person left on Earth (besides Thanos himself as we&#39;re gonna assume he&#39;s immune&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/thanos-snap.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1:1&quot;&gt;[1:1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so he won&#39;t die halfway through the snapping), he could just kill the guy with his bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace all the 1&#39;s with 7,951,000,000&#39;s and we get the number of people left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&#39;s infinite, like if we assume a person &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be chopped into infinite bits, we can say that the number of people left alive approaches zero as the number of snaps approaches infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resurrecting Old Ideas and Magic Academies</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/resurrecting-old-ideas-and-magic-academies.html" />
    <updated>2024-09-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/resurrecting-old-ideas-and-magic-academies.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is a post from Cohost, reposted here.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an idea in middle school of a comic featuring people who naturally look like Homestuck god-tiers who are attending to a school on a mountain. It was never finished -- hardly even started -- but if I don&#39;t talk about it here it&#39;s going to die in my head forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it&#39;s been a while and I&#39;ve forgotten most stuff, and the original notebook I drew the thing on was probably lost after we moved, but here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people are all Homestuck-white and have Homestuck-god wings, wearing Homestuck-god hoodies. Each with a unique wing / eye / text-color, which turned into &amp;quot;accent colors&amp;quot; in TIR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person has a &amp;quot;partner,&amp;quot; and can&#39;t sleep unless the partner is awake, and can&#39;t wake up unless the partner is asleep. Yes, like dream-selves. You can already see how similar this is to Homestuck. Except the &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; is someone else that actually exists as an independent person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the school part, it is more like a college despite being called a middle school, and instead of choosing a major, the school assigns one to you based on what they think you&#39;ll do best in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our protagonist, Ribbon, got into &amp;quot;News.&amp;quot; Her friend Eva got into &amp;quot;Detective.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you&#39;re seeing parallels to TIR: two most important things in Hillslope are the press and Sparky&#39;s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two characters, Ribbon and Sky, are originally created here. (At least, the accent colors and Chinese names are the same.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story would involve a mystery of a thief and how Eva and Ribbon solve it, Eva using her detective skills and Ribbon using the Power of Propaganda&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; since her class runs the school newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&#39;t ever plan on resurrecting this comic, but I do reuse some aspects of it, like the thief plot, Ribbon and Sky, and the school-in-a-mountain. Qibli is to be attending a magic academy in a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi. Tofutush here. Or Sirocco, whichever name you know me by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDK why I started a blog. I&#39;m not a writer. But I just figured I wanted to do something about this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeesh I ran out of things to say pretty quickly. How about I tell you about my name, Tofutush. It&#39;s a silly name from Captain Underpants. Wow how old am I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like comics and my OCs. Look at them &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gotta put a link to every site I&#39;m on. Not a lot, mind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://toyhou.se/Tofutush&quot;&gt;Toyhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://artfight.net/~Tofutush&quot;&gt;Artfight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord (tofutush)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to go on Cohost. But then it shut down. This site&#39;s color scheme is taken from there.&lt;/p&gt;
