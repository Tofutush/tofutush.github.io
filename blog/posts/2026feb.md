I almost forgot about this… but here goes nothing.

## How was the month?

Turned 19. Actually started school. Agonized over school. It's getting warmer near the end. Had some lows. Maybe seasonal depression is kicking in.

## Milestones

- 19 years old!

This section is honestly not that different from "stuff I did…" It should be for like, big stuff. Like graduating, or getting a driver's license. So expect this section to be empty most of the time.

## Stuff I did

- Published the [Bauhinian Text Converter](https://tofutush.github.io/bauhinian/)!
- Finishing touches to the [Blue Prince House Builder](https://tofutush.github.io/blue-prince-house-builder/).
- Obtained all trophies in Blue Prince.
- Home page revamp of TIR site.
- Image system overhaul of TIR site.
- Started playing *Stardew Valley*.

## Stuff I want to do

- Finish re-reading *Wings of Fire*.
- Not die during spring break.
- Kill all Chinese-American authors.

So uh yeah. So long!
