Cool new idea: Harmony, after getting the mission to collect incriminating evidence on her parents, thought that she would find none, because of course her parents aren't criminals! So she made shit up with the scanty stuff she had on them. And turns out they (at least Frosting) *did* get arrested for that and it broke her heart.

How does it justify her eagerness to join the MSS alongside Sugarcane later though?

content: Decided to start a microblog! Will post random stuff in here that are too short for posts. Usually I spit them into my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XzdA5vKkb2), but maybe if I spit too much the Social Media Overlords will come after my ass, who knows. It would also be nice to keep an archive of ideas, so it's easier to reference them later!

I foresee my future workflow being still spitting into Discord, but updating this here afterwards if I think it's worth saving.
