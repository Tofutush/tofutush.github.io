I don't remember dreams that much, nor am I a lucid dreamer or something. But occasionally I remember a dream, and I write it down quickly. Here are some of them. They're usually really weird, so be warned.

## 1

One time I dreamt that China was going to war with Turkey. On land. No idea how though. I was pushing one of those wheeled barbecue stands on the battlefield, and whenever Turkish soldiers got close enough, the BBQ stand would turn into a tank and knock them away.

In the dream it was explained extremely clearly why they were knocked away: because the tank was way bigger than a BBQ stand, the size increase shoved them away and accelerated them.

This was also the first time I had a dream within a dream. I woke up from the dream to post a Wechat moment post about it, but then I woke up for real on my bed.

You notice how in dreams, you don't figure out something, you just *know* it and take the knowledge for granted? Like I didn't see anyone's faces, I don't know where I was, but I knew they were Turkish.

There was another time when I was sleeping in the car while my dad drove. I dreamt that he had me by the neck and was insistently telling me a story about how a man murdered all his subordinates one by one. Funniest thing was when I woke up, he asked me if I slept well. I answered, "okay."

This is a long one. Bear with me.

It started with some goddamn *narration*. This is a world where humans are incapable of understanding chemistry and biology. Just, plain intellectually incapable of studying them. The sky was a gloomy apocalyptic red and the trees were bare, and I was in jail. Not normal jail, but a prison for "unverified" people.

But then a lot of things happened and I got out somehow, and I was in a school. I had to find someone. I was in a hallway with a window at the end not unlike my school IRL, and a student came out from a classroom. The sun was rising and he hadn't slept the entire night. A teacher came out after him, who had also stayed up the whole night, trying to figure something out to no avail, because humans are incapable of understanding anything related to chemistry and biology.

And then a UFO hit the school.

And the student saw two people by the lake, one of which was the guy I was looking for. I ran down to the lake, and met them as they walked towards the building. Someone was running with me, no idea who, but we were each given something that resembled food. I was about to eat it when my dad came, took it, and threw it into the lake. He took me away, saying "what was the 4th rule I taught you?" I couldn't remember. He said, "don't eat food given to you by strangers."

We walked through a woods. He told me some thing about verification along the way, (I couldn't remember after waking up) and at the edge of the woods he said, "it's north up ahead. Keep walking and you'll reach Beijing." I told him that it was south, and we had to turn back, *that* was north. I turned around and looked back into the woods. The apocalyptic red that was the backdrop of the entire dream up until this point was replaced by an eerie blue. I saw a policeman hiding behind a tree and peeking at me. My dad insisted that north was up ahead. I glanced at the policeman again and decided to just walk forward, realizing that he was right and that *was* indeed north.

I was walking on pavement now, and heard a gun being loaded behind me. I immediately threw up my hands, blabbering about how I did nothing wrong. The policeman from the woods walked past me, staring at me like I was an idiot, and I realized that he had not been following me at all and I was just overreacting. Still, he took me through a busy street and into a police station, where we went to the second floor, and he asked me to climb down a vertical ladder leading down to the busy street we just came from.

This was the second dream-within-a-dream I had. I woke up from that to me writing down the dream in my computer, but I ended up writing something about the life of a chef. And then I woke up for real.

The UFO never came up a second time. It was a huge disk, crashing into the school grounds, and apparently nobody questioned it.

I was in a karaoke bar. I thought to myself, "now I know how to take off my pants," because the last time I was here I didn't know how. Then I saw two white cats, so I scooped them up and hailed a taxi. The first driver didn't allow pets, so I hailed a second one. My mom was on there for some reason. We were going to find someone. The driver said, "let's go to the graduate school he attends." Mom was surprised. "He's already working?" The driver lowered her voice and said, "he's the first to get red-checked[^1]!"

## Thoughts

I've never read too much upon how dreams reflect your inner state of mind or something, mainly because my dreams are so nonsensical, like these. What can you know about me from these dreams? I don't even know. Maybe except for the red-check thing. That obviously came from playing Werewolves too much.

[^1]: I'm not sure if it's the right jargon here, but I'm referring to when playing Werewolves, someone who claims they're the seer says this person is a wolf.
