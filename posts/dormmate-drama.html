<p><em>(Warning: this post is a little vent-y)</em></p>
<p>I wanted to write a little about the dormmate I had.</p>
<p>She used to be from another fancy private school<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, but transferred here at the start of 12th grade. Which is technically impossible, transferring from a private school to a public one. I don't know how she — more specifically, her parents — did that.</p>
<p>We also get random new dorms each school year, so just by chance, I got lumped in with her. There were supposed to be 4 people, but only 3 really stay there.</p>
<p>I don't beef with my dormmates. We usually get along well. But not her. She was spoiled rotten — guess I should've expected it. Her parents could get her transferred to a public school, after all. But the thing is, I <em>don't</em> mind. I don't mind her personal lifestyle habits; I don't mind if she has to take 30-min long showers and blow her hair for an additional 20; I don't mind if she had to sleep through the first period; I don't mind if she has to use 2 desks to put all her stuff, since there were only 3 people anyways so we had a spare desk. I <em>don't</em> mind any of these.</p>
<p>What I <em>do</em> mind, a <em>lot</em>, is her blatant disrespect for everybody else. It was like she thought she was the main character and everyone else is an NPC.</p>
<p>We got along for a while. But there were signs. The most obvious one was the card thing. We had to use our school cards to swipe the dorm door open. One day, I was inside and heard knocking, so I opened the door. She was outside and went in. I asked her, in a chitchat manner, &quot;forgot your card?&quot; And she replied, &quot;no, it's in my bag, it's just too much trouble to take it out.&quot;</p>
<p>There were so many things wrong with this interaction I don't even know where to start. She legit thought it was okay to trouble other people to avoid troubling herself. And the fact that she <em>said</em> it out loud, to my face, proves that she <em>did not even think that was wrong</em>. I'm convinced that to this day, as I'm writing this post, she still thinks that <em>I</em> am the asshole for not even wanting to do the extremely simple task of opening the door at her bidding — can't Tofu <em>see</em> how hard it is for me to take the card out of my bag??/s</p>
<p>(By the way, we use our cards to buy food too — would be a shame if she starved because she could not get her card out of her bag.)</p>
<p>That was the first time. On the second time, after asking &quot;forgot your card?&quot; and receiving a similar answer again, I got pissed and said, &quot;I'm just a servant to you, right?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>&quot; Upon hearing that, she slammed the door — which was nice, actually; she loves leaving the door open behind her until someone else (usually me) goes to close it.</p>
<p>I don't know her exact age but she couldn't have been younger than 17. We're nearly adults. She still acts like a literal spoiled baby.</p>
<p>Apparently, my servant statement was the breaking point for her. Yeah, an off-handed, casual half-insult. During later arguments she would constantly bring that line up and go &quot;how are you a servant? How come I think you're my servant?&quot; or something like that, probably thinking she actually had a coherent argument, or anything better she could nitpick about my behavior. Again, like a child.</p>
<p>The breaking point for <em>me</em>, however, was the trash can thing. So our dorms don't have trash cans in them; we had to bring our own. But most of the time, there were cans left by the previous inhabitants of the dorm. Not this time though. So I brought a trash can here, along with trash bags, for us three to use.</p>
<p>I had <em>one</em> rule: if it's empty, put a bag in it. The bags are here. Right here, for everyone to take. Grab one. Put it in the can. And <em>then</em> throw trash.</p>
<p>She kept on throwing trash into a bare can. I talked to her. I told her, the bags are right there, put one in! She could take none of it. I didn't throw wet stuff! Those are all dry stuff that wouldn't stick to the can! What's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Km km. It is my trash can; you can follow my <em>one and only rule</em> or I could just <em>not</em> let you use it.</p>
<p>I put the can on my table. It's mine now. Neither of you gets to use it. Actually I would've let the third girl use it anyways since <em>she</em> didn't do anything wrong, but whatever.</p>
<p>Then came the maddening thing: she <strong>still threw stuff into the can anyways</strong>. <strong>Not only behind my back, but also right in front of me, even!</strong> She walked over to me desk, threw some shit in, muttering &quot;I'll borrow this for a bit, thank you<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.&quot;</p>
<p>If I carved her face out, my family won't have to buy extra food for a month. That's how thick her skin is.</p>
<p>Heated arguments; the dorm manager got involved; she was yelling, screaming incoherent bullshit — clearly on the defensive, which worked, since neither me nor the dorm manager could get a word in; and when she finally allowed our input she would cut into our speech about three characters in. The funniest thing was once she mentioned how I was constantly getting in fights with other dormmates, even before she shared a dorm with me — the third girl told her that! Which was funny on so many levels. She was the &quot;new kid&quot; and she dared talk about my past in front of the dorm manager, who had known me for two previous years? In addition, this was my first time sharing a dorm with the third girl too. This convinced me even more that she thinks we're all NPCs.</p>
<p>For a long while, even just thinking about her made my blood boil. Fortunately, sometimes she goes home to sleep. Unfortunately, it means every night is a surprise of &quot;will she be here?&quot;</p>
<p>Something had to change. I used to think that there's only one semester left, so I could roll with it; and if I quit, or moved to another dorm, it would be me losing. She'd win, and I'd lose. Looking back, that was <em>extremely</em> childish.</p>
<p>But I decided to move. There was an empty spot in a dorm full of my friends, so I moved there.</p>
<p>There were a lot of physical problems in that dorm. The door can't be closed properly and water keeps leaking out from mysterious places. But I am <em>happy</em>. I am with my friends! I started looking forward to each night, instead of dreading them.</p>
<p>So, if you'll excuse me sounding like a sloppy old cartoon moral narrator: sometimes we get in situations that make us uncomfortable and we just go with it, thinking we could handle it. Maybe its annoying dormmates, or maybe it could be a relationship we no longer wanna be in, etc. Move the hell out. There's got to be somewhere we can move to!</p>

<p>Wow, my longest post yet, a vent post. Venting sure is the muse of inspiration!</p>

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>When we started high school there was a kid on the roll-call, but she never attended, and we were told she decided to go to some private school. They had the same surname but I couldn't remember the girl's full name, so I couldn't make assumptions. But if they were indeed the same person, then she didn't technically transfer here I guess.
