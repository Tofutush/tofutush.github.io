*(This is a post from Cohost, reposted here.)*

I had an idea in middle school of a comic featuring people who naturally look like Homestuck god-tiers who are attending to a school on a mountain. It was never finished -- hardly even started -- but if I don't talk about it here it's going to die in my head forever.

So, it's been a while and I've forgotten most stuff, and the original notebook I drew the thing on was probably lost after we moved, but here:

The people are all Homestuck-white and have Homestuck-god wings, wearing Homestuck-god hoodies. Each with a unique wing / eye / text-color, which turned into "accent colors" in TIR.

Each person has a "partner," and can't sleep unless the partner is awake, and can't wake up unless the partner is asleep. Yes, like dream-selves. You can already see how similar this is to Homestuck. Except the "partner" is someone else that actually exists as an independent person.

For the school part, it is more like a college despite being called a middle school, and instead of choosing a major, the school assigns one to you based on what they think you'll do best in.

Our protagonist, Ribbon, got into "News." Her friend Eva got into "Detective."

Now you're seeing parallels to TIR: two most important things in Hillslope are the press and Sparky's investigation.

Two characters, Ribbon and Sky, are originally created here. (At least, the accent colors and Chinese names are the same.)

The story would involve a mystery of a thief and how Eva and Ribbon solve it, Eva using her detective skills and Ribbon using the Power of Propaganda<sup>tm</sup> since her class runs the school newspaper.

Now, I don't ever plan on resurrecting this comic, but I do reuse some aspects of it, like the thief plot, Ribbon and Sky, and the school-in-a-mountain. Qibli is to be attending a magic academy in a mountain.
