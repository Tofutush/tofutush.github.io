77. when did you first regularly start going online?

In fifth grade, I think. That was when I got Tiktok (or Douyin if you're insistent on using different names. I don't think the international version was released back then?). Yeah bad times. But coincidentally it was what got me into websites in the first place! Like seriously! I saw some videos that was just someone's computer screen opening up notepad, typing in a bunch of cryptic stuff (literally just HTML and JS) which was too sped-up to copy (and half cut-off at the edge of the screen), to make silly little interactions like "do you love me?" and the "no" button turns into "yes" when you hover it. I was fascinated by that and wanted to learn to make stuff like that myself.

Tiktok is still hell though; stay away.
