Funny way how I found out this book existed. I found this game online called [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/) which is basically a country simulator. So I created Bauhinia, or attempted to but the name was fucking taken by some tasteless stranger! But it was going to expire soon, so I made Bauhinia after it did.

And then I got too overwhelmed by stuff that I didn't know what buttons to click, and left it at that. Today, I logged on again, found that Bauhinia was long gone because I hadn't logged in for so long, but I could restore it, so I did.

The Republic of Bauhinia had the flag of Hong Kong because you could only choose from existing flags. It was a "Compulsory Consumerist State," and the blurb quote read, "Hahahahaha." Yeah that was past me's doing. It has good civil rights, very strong economy, and rare political freedom.

Here's the entire profile description. It was so epic I decided to paste the entire thing here.

> The Republic of Bauhinia is a large, efficient nation, renowned for its barren, inhospitable landscape, irreverence towards religion, and complete absence of social welfare. The hard-nosed, hard-working, cynical population of 112 million Bauhinians are rabid consumers, partly through choice and partly because the government tells them to and dissenters tend to vanish from their homes at night.
>
> The minute, well-organized government, or what there is of one, prioritizes Law & Order, although Healthcare, Education, and Defense are also considered important, while Spirituality and International Aid are ignored. Citizens pay a flat income tax of 5.5%.
>
> The very strong Bauhinian economy, worth 8.10 trillion bucks a year, is driven almost entirely by the private sector, which is broadly diversified and led by the Door-to-door Insurance Sales industry, with major contributions from Gambling, Information Technology, and Book Publishing. Average income is 72,331 bucks, but there is a significant disparity between incomes, with the richest 10% of citizens earning 213,170 per year while the poor average 19,312, a ratio of 11.0 to 1.
>
> The mining industry is making inroads into environmentally sensitive areas, organ donation is compulsory, the latest Harry Potter book is a bestseller, and Bauhinian watches are often the only thing to survive a disaster intact. Crime is a problem, with the police force struggling against a lack of funding and a high mortality rate. Bauhinia's national animal is the Puppy, which teeters on the brink of extinction due to widespread deforestation.
>
> Bauhinia is ranked 192,079th in the world and 7,971st in Osiris for Most Advanced Law Enforcement, scoring 1,203.88 on the Orwell Orderliness Index.

Here's the recent events list:

- Seconds ago: Bauhinia  was refounded in Osiris.
- 1 year 70 days ago: Bauhinia  ceased to exist in The West Pacific.
- 1 year 97 days ago: Bauhinia was ranked in the Top 1% of the world for Largest Insurance Industry, the Top 5% for Lowest Overall Tax Burden and Largest Gambling Industry, and the Top 10% for Largest Publishing Industry and Highest Disposable Incomes.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Bauhinia's influence in The West Pacific rose from "Zero" to "Unproven".
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, Bauhinian watches are often the only thing to survive a disaster intact.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, the latest Harry Potter book is a bestseller.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, organ donation is compulsory.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, the mining industry is making inroads into environmentally sensitive areas.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Bauhinia was founded in The West Pacific.

But alright, none of that was actually on topic. I might log in every year or so just to hog Bauhinia's name though. The thing is, the developer of the game, Max Barry, also wrote books, and they looked quite interesting, so I added them to my booklist where they promptly collected digital dust for about 1 year 90 days. But recently I decided to go ahead with one of them to see: do I let the *other* books continue to collect digital dust, or do I get rid of them?

So I started to read *Jennifer Government*. Its premise is that, this is an ultra-Capitalist USA society, and people take on the last names of their employers. So we have Hack Nike, Billy Bechtel, people like that. Kids are apparently named after the school they attend, like Hayley McDonalds[^1], because all schools were funded by private companies too. Unemployed people, and I assume babies, have no last name. And Jennifer Government, as you can well guess, works for the government. And these people get in trouble as their lives intertwine and stuff. It was a solid and promising premise, and what caught my attention in the first place.

I've always thought I wasn't good enough of a writer to review books, but like. I'm doing it because I actually felt like I have something to say. So yeah, I'm saying them. Obviously, **spoiler alert**, though there's still blacked-out text.

First of all, why are they named Hack and Buy? Just why?

- short chapters, can be merged
	- weird titles
- hayleys death: unexplored potential, could be someone else, hayley goes to buy for help
- very shallow worldview. just welfare states vs not
- role of government? looks like fbi
	- processing name changes all day
- europe, welfare states?

[^1]: Personally, I would off myself if my school uniform had a huge McDonalds logo at the back.
