Part 3 of my review of the entire Wings of Fire series. Same rules apply, **spoilers ahead**!

The "prophecy at the start of a book" structure was really starting to wear off on here, because the prophecy didn't even appear until like book 4.

They pulled out another continent with brand new dragon tribes for this. Everyone does that eventually I suppose, and it's often a trainwreck central, and this arc overall is indeed my least favorite (2 > 1 > 3 IMO), but it does house the book that's the absolute best in the series (and also the worst) and the author only really trainwrecked at the very very end. If arcs 1 and 2 are all peak after peak, this one was quite the roller-coaster.
