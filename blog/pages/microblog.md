Feeling awful at the Chinese site again… why does that thing always bring me the most agony. I need to accept that it would always be hell to maintain and would always be outdated and incomplete.

I need to start writing down reasons why I rejected ideas. Because I keep getting the same ideas again and forgetting why they were scraped the first time I got them.

The Blue Prince House Builder is coming along well! Sometimes, I wonder if anyone is actually going to like these sorts of silly projects. But who cares, if I enjoy the process of making it, and learned from it? But that always brings me to the more difficult question — did I truly learn anything from it? Svelte is still a mess to me, and I'm pretty sure it's horrible practice to pass a function down from `App` into `Directory` and finally into `RoomDir` where it's called. But well, I'm going to invoke sunk cost fallacy and say, I've come so far.

I came up with a media review framework:

- **Did I like it?**
- **Would I read / watch / play it again?**
- **Would I grab a random stranger off the street and make them read / watch / play it?**
- **If someone wants to read / watch / play it, would I throw myself in like a human shield to protect them from harm?**

Why do I feel like my ability to learn and comprehend is eroding in real time… I just wanna make a simple Svelte project…

Yay, I'm no longer writing posts in JSON! Now I can open up Obsidian and just write from there. Satisfying.

Cool new idea: Harmony, after getting the mission to collect incriminating evidence on her parents, thought that she would find none, because of course her parents aren't criminals! So she made shit up with the scanty stuff she had on them. And turns out they (at least Frosting) *did* get arrested for that and it broke her heart.

How does it justify her eagerness to join the MSS alongside Sugarcane later though?

Decided to start a microblog! Will post random stuff in here that are too short for posts. Usually I spit them into my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XzdA5vKkb2), but maybe if I spit too much the Social Media Overlords will come after my ass, who knows. It would also be nice to keep an archive of ideas, so it's easier to reference them later!

I foresee my future workflow being still spitting into Discord, but updating this here afterwards if I think it's worth saving.
