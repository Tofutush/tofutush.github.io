<h1>OC Creator Questionnaire!</h1>
<p>Here's a questionnaire I made for people who make OCs! Note that this is for <em>you</em>, not any individual OC you have.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">1. A little self-introduction!



2. How long have you been making OCs?



3. Who was your first OC ever? (If you don't remember, answer for the earliest that you do remember.) Are they still in use? Did they go through any iterations?



4. Who is your favorite OC, currently?



5. Who is your newest OC as of right now?



6. How many OCs do you have? If you have multiple, then do you have blatant favoritism?



7. Do you create OCs with other people, or is it mostly solitary?



8. Do you create your OCs for specific story(s)? What are the genre and common themes featured in your story(s)?



9. Are your OCs from a fandom?



10. Do your OCs live in their own universe(s)? How different is their world from ours? (If you have fandom OCs you can still answer this with the world of the franchise!)



11. If you got isekai'ed into your OCs' universe (if there are multiple, pick some of the most notable), how long would you survive?



12. Do most your OCs belong to a (set of) species?



13. Do you draw pictures of your OCs? If so, what kind of pictures do you draw?



14. Do you enjoy drawing new reference sheets?



15. Do you write about your OCs? If so, what sort of text do you write?



16. Aside from drawing and writing, is there anything else you're doing for your OCs? Like… making a website, perhaps?



17. What's your general process in making new OCs?



18. Relatedly, which comes first for you, the OC or the story setting?



19. Relatedly, how do you name your OCs?



20. Relatedly, do your OCs gain a life of their own during the creation process?



21. Relatedly, do you focus more on the design of the OC, or their personality? Or is it an even blend, or something else?



22. Do you assign your OCs birthdays? Is their calendar different from ours?



23. Do you keep track of OC creation dates? Do you consider the creation date to be their birthdays?



24. How do you handle OC ages? Do they age up with you, stay static, or grow within the universe?



25. Are there any rules you set for yourself when making OCs? How often do you break these self-imposed rules?



26. What are things you enjoy the most in OCs?



27. Conversely, what are your pet peeves about OCs?



28. What's the most common trope you fall into when making OCs and their stories? Do you even like these tropes?



29. Conversely, do you have any trope you like but doesn't get to use it much in your OCs?



30. Tell me the weirdest and wackiest piece of out-of-context OC lore you have.



31. Tell me the saddest and most tearjerking piece of OC lore you have, with context if needed.



32. Tell me the scariest and freakiest piece of OC lore you have, with context if needed.



33. Tell me the sweetest and most wholesome piece of OC lore you have, with context if needed.



34. Tell me one meta thing about your OC lore. Like scrapped / revamped stuff?



35. How do you think your OCs think of you? Are you their parent, their creation god, their suffering-bringer…



36. How much TRAUMA do you give your OCs!!



37. Do you have a Mary Sue? Bonus points if they're your self-insert!



38. Do you have a self-insert then? What role(s) do they play?



39. What are your biggest influences when it comes to OC or worldbuilding? Could be media, other people's OCs, anything.



40. Are you happy with these influences, or would you like to break away more?



41. Do you try to break out of your comfort zone when coming up with new OCs and stories?



42. How do you organize / categorize your OCs, if at all?



43. Do you have any advice you would like to give to new OC creators?



44. What are some boundaries you think people should have regarding other people's OCs (or things to take notice of if you create together)?



45. How often do you think about your OCs, expressed as a percentage of your waking time?



46. What impacts do you think your OCs had on your life?



47. Do you want to become POPULAR? If you are already popular, what's the secret ingredient?? :eyes: :eyes:



48. Are there any songs you think describe an OC or a story perfectly?



49. Might you have a paracosm? Look it up!



50. Finally, do you still recognize the word "OC" after seeing it so much?</code></pre>
