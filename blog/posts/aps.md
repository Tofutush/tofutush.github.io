I recently finished *A Perfect Spy* by John le Carré. It was a great book.

One interesting thing of note is that this book, the author had stated, is semi-autobiographical. And the main character kills himself in the end.

He said it's what he would've went through if he had stayed in the MI6. Why did he leave? Kim Philby blew him, LMAO.
