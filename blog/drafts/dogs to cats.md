title: I used to like dogs but now I like cats more.

When I was little I was a huge dog person. I drew puppies all the time and could name breeds at a glance. I dreamed of keeping a husky.

But now if you ask me, I would say I'm a cat person. Not that I *don't* like dogs anymore; I just like cats more now. I could pretty clearly explain the reasons why.

First, back then, I didn't like cats because I knew nothing about them. All my attention was on dogs that I never knew there were different breeds and colors to cats too.

*Warrior Cats* was the turning point for me. I didn't want to read it at first because it's about *cats* and that's *boring come on* but when I started reading it, I fell in love with it. I started to draw the characters, make cat OCs, and slowly started to like cats more.

And then there's actually getting to know the real animals, rather than imaginary characters and pictures. Cat fur feels so soft and comfortable, and they clean themselves regularly. Dog fur, on the other handâ€¦ maybe I just haven't pet a Samoyed or something but all the dogs I've pet have hard fur that felt like plastic wires. Golden retrievers, Labradors, poodles, and a couple of Tibetan Terriers once. They are not fun to touch, and they move around too often; too energetic.

Also my mom got a cat a couple of years back and she is adorable. Her name is Sandstorm. I love her.
