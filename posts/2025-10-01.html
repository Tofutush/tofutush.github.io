<p>I feel like I often use too much of the phrases &quot;in my opinion&quot; or &quot;I think&quot; here. Which is stupid, because this is <em>my blog</em>. What do you think I write, if not my opinions? Literature reviews?</p>
<p>I should refrain from these phrases as much as possible in the future. This is my blog; I don't need to walk on eggshells, going &quot;I think cats are cute, this is just my personal opinion of course, other people might have different opinions and they're totally valid too, it's just in my humble opinion that cats are cute.&quot;</p>
<p>You should check if you use too much of this type of language too. Thanks for listening to my TED talk I guess.</p>
