title: Media Log

[[toc]]

I will log the media I enjoyed here. Only titles so the page doesn't get too messy; if I liked something enough to write a post, I'd link it here.

- Things from the past will be added gradually.
- Ordered by whenever I added them to the list.
- Fanworks will be listed beneath the work itself.
- No rating because I like them all; I won't log the things I hate.
