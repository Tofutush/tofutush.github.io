		<h1>Resurrecting Old Ideas and Magic Academies</h1>
<p class="date">Posted: 2024-09-29
<p><em>(This is a post from Cohost, reposted here.)</em></p>
<p>I had an idea in middle school of a comic featuring people who naturally look like Homestuck god-tiers who are attending to a school on a mountain. It was never finished — hardly even started — but if I don't talk about it here it's going to die in my head forever.</p>
<p>So, it's been a while and I've forgotten most stuff, and the original notebook I drew the thing on was probably lost after we moved, but here:</p>
<p>The people are all Homestuck-white and have Homestuck-god wings, wearing Homestuck-god hoodies. Each with a unique wing / eye / text-color, which turned into &quot;accent colors&quot; in TIR.</p>
<p>Each person has a &quot;partner,&quot; and can't sleep unless the partner is awake, and can't wake up unless the partner is asleep. Yes, like dream-selves. You can already see how similar this is to Homestuck. Except the &quot;partner&quot; is someone else that actually exists as an independent person.</p>
<p>For the school part, it is more like a college despite being called a middle school, and instead of choosing a major, the school assigns one to you based on what they think you'll do best in.</p>
<p>Our protagonist, Ribbon, got into &quot;News.&quot; Her friend Eva got into &quot;Detective.&quot;</p>
<p>Now you're seeing parallels to TIR: two most important things in Hillslope are the press and Sparky's investigation.</p>
<p>Two characters, Ribbon and Sky, are originally created here. (At least, the accent colors and Chinese names are the same.)</p>
<p>The story would involve a mystery of a thief and how Eva and Ribbon solve it, Eva using her detective skills and Ribbon using the Power of Propaganda<sup>tm</sup> since her class runs the school newspaper.</p>
<p>Now, I don't ever plan on resurrecting this comic, but I do reuse some aspects of it, like the thief plot, Ribbon and Sky, and the school-in-a-mountain. Qibli is to be attending a magic academy in a mountain.</p>
