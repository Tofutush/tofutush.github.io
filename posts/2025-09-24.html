		<h1>On things we don't understand</h1>
<p class="date">Posted: 2025-09-24
<p>I keep thinking back to when my mom and I were in Xinjiang, and we saw a bulletin board about the different types of wild animals local to the area, written in both Chinese and Uyghurche. My mom was all like, &quot;these letters all look the same to me!&quot; Even after I repeatedly told her &quot;they look the same because you can't read them. They will look vastly different if you <em>can</em> read it. Conversely, all Chinese characters would look the same to someone who can't read Chinese.&quot; She then said, &quot;well Chinese is really obvious, the characters are all different! But for this, all the letters are the same!&quot;</p>
<p>We repeated our words a couple times over to each other, an extremely unproductive conversation of &quot;how could anyone understand this?&quot; &quot;They can, you cannot! They can't understand Chinese either!&quot; &quot;But how could anyone understand this?&quot; … She even brought it up again when we went back to Shenzhen and saw some Uyghur restaurants with the Arabic script Uyghurche written on the sign. By then, I had begun learning Uyghurche, and could read a little bit of the pronunciation — despite me literally reading the sign out to her (although I still didn't understand what the sign said either), she was <em>still</em> like, &quot;how could anyone understand this?&quot;</p>
<p>It strikes me as interesting how when we saw something we didn't understand, my mom's reaction was largely negative towards it, and had a very stubborn layer of assuming nobody else could understand it if she herself could not; and assuming other people can understand anything that she can understand.</p>
<p>My mom was getting old, so I don't blame her for repeating things and not listening to me. But I can't help but think about this mentality. This goes deeper than a negative attitude towards things we don't understand, like I mentioned before; there's this inability to see things from other people's viewpoint. My mom, being able to read Chinese but not Uyghurche, cannot imagine a person being able to read Uyghurche but not Chinese. Uyghurche was gibberish to her, so she can't imagine anyone comprehending it; Chinese was very clear to her, so she can't imagine anyone seeing it as gibberish.</p>
<p>Which leads me to think about whether I had done this too. It goes beyond just languages and cultures; it includes anything I cannot understand or appreciate, like abstract art, religion, philosophy, or just about anything that appears too &quot;abstract&quot; to me. Would my rejection of them make me un-accepting to new ideas? Conversely, for things I do like and understand, like just English for a quick example, might I appear too haughty to people who don't understand it as well as I do? This should be something to keep in mind.</p>
