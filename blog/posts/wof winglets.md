Part 4 of my review of the entire Wings of Fire series. Same rules apply, **spoilers ahead**!

Oh my god just because they're little short filler novellas doesn't mean the author just slacked on them. These are all very much peak too.

## Prisoners

## Assassin

## Deserter

## Runaway

## So, arc 4?

I still have high hopes, despite the absolute trainwreck that was book 15. Because this author is clearly very, very good. A couple trainwrecks out of 15+ books isn't that high of an amount. Besides, while all the other books were published within a year of each other, this one had a 4-year gap with book 15. I don't know what she was doing these 4 years, but I hope that means she had time to cook.

Allow me to complain about the comics though. They're fucking ugly. I saw the cover and a couple pages and was like. Wow nah. Also what is it with people always drawing Glory with green scales and orange wings? I don't even recall the author describing her like that even once!
