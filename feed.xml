    <title>Resurrecting old ideas and magic academies</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is a post from Cohost, reposted here.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an idea in middle school of a comic featuring people who naturally look like Homestuck god-tiers who are attending to a school on a mountain. It was never finished — hardly even started — but if I don&#39;t talk about it here it&#39;s going to die in my head forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it&#39;s been a while and I&#39;ve forgotten most stuff, and the original notebook I drew the thing on was probably lost after we moved, but here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people are all Homestuck-white and have Homestuck-god wings, wearing Homestuck-god hoodies. Each with a unique wing / eye / text-color, which turned into &amp;quot;accent colors&amp;quot; in TIR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person has a &amp;quot;partner,&amp;quot; and can&#39;t sleep unless the partner is awake, and can&#39;t wake up unless the partner is asleep. Yes, like dream-selves. You can already see how similar this is to Homestuck. Except the &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; is someone else that actually exists as an independent person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the school part, it is more like a college despite being called a middle school, and instead of choosing a major, the school assigns one to you based on what they think you&#39;ll do best in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our protagonist, Ribbon, got into &amp;quot;News.&amp;quot; Her friend Eva got into &amp;quot;Detective.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you&#39;re seeing parallels to TIR: two most important things in Hillslope are the press and Sparky&#39;s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two characters, Ribbon and Sky, are originally created here. (At least, the accent colors and Chinese names are the same.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story would involve a mystery of a thief and how Eva and Ribbon solve it, Eva using her detective skills and Ribbon using the Power of Propaganda&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; since her class runs the school newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&#39;t ever plan on resurrecting this comic, but I do reuse some aspects of it, like the thief plot, Ribbon and Sky, and the school-in-a-mountain. Qibli is to be attending a magic academy in a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thanos snap</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-10-15.html" />

    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-10-15.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or, Achilles chases the turtle but genocide instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine today said as an exasperated joke, &amp;quot;I am Thanos and I would snap two times and kill everyone!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was like, &amp;quot;Well actually you can only kill 75%. Because after you snapped once, only half were left, and if you snap again you can only kill a fourth.&amp;quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-10-15.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that logic, Thanos can never kill everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that he can, because you can&#39;t split one person into infinitely small pieces. When there&#39;s one last person left on Earth (besides Thanos himself as we&#39;re gonna assume he&#39;s immune&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-10-15.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1:1&quot;&gt;[1:1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so he won&#39;t die halfway through the snapping), he could just kill the guy with his bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time he snaps, the number of people in the world decreases by a half. The percentage of people left forms a series that stops until &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;2^n&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.664392em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut bottom&quot; style=&quot;height:0.664392em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base textstyle uncramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-0.363em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;reset-textstyle scriptstyle uncramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;baseline-fix&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reaches the current world population, which we&#39;re gonna say is 7,951,000,000,000:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow did I seriously just spend half an hour wondering how to kill everyone on Earth? I think I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese culture revolves around stupid puns</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html" />
    <updated>2024-12-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was thinking recently about how Chinese culture kind of revolves around stupid puns&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&#39;t you gift someone clocks or cups? Because puns. &amp;quot;Gifting clocks&amp;quot; (送钟 sòng zhōng) sounds identical to &amp;quot;hosting a funeral&amp;quot;(送终 sòng zhōng). By extension, you can&#39;t gift anything that lets you read the time either, like watches. &amp;quot;Cups&amp;quot; (杯具 bēi jù) sounds identical to &amp;quot;tragedy&amp;quot; (悲剧 bēi jù) so yeah, cups are also bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s really funny to me personally, after I learned it, is how you can&#39;t cut your hair in January&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; because your uncle would die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is long-winded. Bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the Qing dynasty men had to do their hair into a silly little braid, which was stupid. Imagine being a guy and being legally obliged to braid your hair. I&#39;d just unalive myself. Actually you know what, I li Anyways, the hairstyle also entailed shaving the top of your head bald. And if you don&#39;t shave it every once in a while your hair would grow back (surprise) and you&#39;d get in jail or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now obviously people hated this, not only because it was stupid but also in Confucian culture you&#39;re not supposed to cut your hair because it came from your parents&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So there birthed a tradition that people won&#39;t shave their hair in January, because &amp;quot;nostalgia&amp;quot; (思旧 sī jiù).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thing spread by word-of-mouth, and then some idiot heard this and went like &amp;quot;Oh? Dead uncle? (死舅 sǐ jiù)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now everyone believes that if you cut your hair in January, your uncle would die. In fact, a lot of barbershops don&#39;t even open during that month, because no one would come anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would&#39;ve been just an interesting tradition if it weren&#39;t for some batshit crazy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was new year 2024, and this guy went for a haircut in a barbershop that was open for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same evening, his uncle died in a car crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn&#39;t the funny part&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The funny part was that his aunt sued him for murder. Her husband died &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; her nephew got that haircut!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thing hit the headlines for a while. It was just so fucking funny. Imagine you&#39;re a judge and some lady wants her nephew executed for getting a haircut. I&#39;d quit my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were those ancient classic stupid puns we had to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; in elementary school. Google tells me they&#39;re either called &amp;quot;idioms&amp;quot; which isn&#39;t that accurate a name, or &amp;quot;truncated witticisms&amp;quot; which I don&#39;t even know what the heck that means. They come in two parts, the first one describing something and the second offering an explanation of the first part — with a pun in there. In elementary school we had those kinds of questions where they put a bunch of first parts and second parts in two columns and we had to match them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most classic example would be the nephew one&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It goes like this: &amp;quot;Nephew lights a lantern — to shine on his uncle.&amp;quot; It&#39;s logical right, if you light a light you wanna light something up. If a nephew does it, it would be to his uncle. The pun comes in the second part, 照舅 (zhào jiù), which sounds identical to &amp;quot;same as usual&amp;quot; (照旧 zhào jiù). So by saying this, you&#39;re saying someone just did the same thing they always did with no change in their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not really limited to old ones. People make new ones all the time too. I remember this one that went like &amp;quot;Anhui gets bombed — Wuhu goes flying.&amp;quot; Wuhu is a city in Anhui province. If Anhui gets bombed, everything inside would get blown away physically, which includes Wuhu city. Wuhu also sounds similar to &amp;quot;woohoo,&amp;quot; and this paired with &amp;quot;goes flying&amp;quot; would mean something like &amp;quot;I&#39;m really happy.&amp;quot; Which is stupid and funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyways that concludes this stupid little post about puns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do I say &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; puns&amp;quot;? Because all puns are ontologically stupid. No matter how clever the pun is it&#39;s still stupid. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically 正月 (zhēng yuѐ), the first month on the Chinese calendar. But whatever. The fault lies in you weird people making up silly names for months. Imagine being a month named &amp;quot;May.&amp;quot; I&#39;d just unalive myself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they happily cut their nails. Don&#39;t your nails also come from your parents? Hypocrites. Have I ever told you Confucian culture was ontologically hypocritical? Now I have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;People dying ain&#39;t funny. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is it with nephews and uncles all over the place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2024-12-30.html#fnref5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I&#39;m learning to drive!</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-09.html" />
    <updated>2025-03-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-09.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Look I know I&#39;m still owing the Counterfeit Monkey and Spider and Web posts, but I wanna talk about my first driving lesson right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coach thought I had been practicing for a long time, and he was surprised when I told him this was my first time touching a steering wheel. I did mistake the gas for the brake and the brake for the gas each once though, and on another occasion forgot to brake when going down a slope, but overall I think I did well! I hit zero people, zero cars, and zero walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main task is just to learn how to drive, instead of passing the test, because even if I got a license in China I&#39;d still have to take another test in the US. But if I got a license in the US I&#39;d be able to change it into a Chinese license. And the test in the US is insanely easy. My mom got a license there, and changed it when we got back in China. She could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; drive I tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of my mom, I also had to convince her yet again that there were peas in the US. This was not the first time we had this conversation. She was getting old.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dormmate drama</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-19.html" />
    <updated>2025-03-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-19.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Warning: this post is a little vent-y)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a little about the dormmate I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She used to be from another fancy private school&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-19.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but transferred here at the start of 12th grade. Which is technically impossible, transferring from a private school to a public one. I don&#39;t know how she — more specifically, her parents — did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also get random new dorms each school year, so just by chance, I got lumped in with her. There were supposed to be 4 people, but only 3 really stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t beef with my dormmates. We usually get along well. But not her. She was spoiled rotten — guess I should&#39;ve expected it. Her parents could get her transferred to a public school, after all. But the thing is, I &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; mind. I don&#39;t mind her personal lifestyle habits; I don&#39;t mind if she has to take 30-min long showers and blow her hair for an additional 20; I don&#39;t mind if she had to sleep through the first period; I don&#39;t mind if she has to use 2 desks to put all her stuff, since there were only 3 people anyways so we had a spare desk. I &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; mind any of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; mind, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, is her blatant disrespect for everybody else. It was like she thought she was the main character and everyone else is an NPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got along for a while. But there were signs. The most obvious one was the card thing. We had to use our school cards to swipe the dorm door open. One day, I was inside and heard knocking, so I opened the door. She was outside and went in. I asked her, in a chitchat manner, &amp;quot;forgot your card?&amp;quot; And she replied, &amp;quot;no, it&#39;s in my bag, it&#39;s just too much trouble to take it out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many things wrong with this interaction I don&#39;t even know where to start. She legit thought it was okay to trouble other people to avoid troubling herself. And the fact that she &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; it out loud, to my face, proves that she &lt;em&gt;did not even think that was wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m convinced that to this day, as I&#39;m writing this post, she still thinks that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am the asshole for not even wanting to do the extremely simple task of opening the door at her bidding — can&#39;t Tofu &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; how hard it is for me to take the card out of my bag??/s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By the way, we use our cards to buy food too — would be a shame if she starved because she could not get her card out of her bag.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the first time. On the second time, after asking &amp;quot;forgot your card?&amp;quot; and receiving a similar answer again, I got pissed and said, &amp;quot;I&#39;m just a servant to you, right?&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-19.html#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;quot; Upon hearing that, she slammed the door — which was nice, actually; she loves leaving the door open behind her until someone else (usually me) goes to close it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know her exact age but she couldn&#39;t have been younger than 17. We&#39;re nearly adults. She still acts like a literal spoiled baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, my servant statement was the breaking point for her. Yeah, an off-handed, casual half-insult. During later arguments she would constantly bring that line up and go &amp;quot;how are you a servant? How come I think you&#39;re my servant?&amp;quot; or something like that, probably thinking she actually had a coherent argument, or anything better she could nitpick about my behavior. Again, like a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breaking point for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, however, was the trash can thing. So our dorms don&#39;t have trash cans in them; we had to bring our own. But most of the time, there were cans left by the previous inhabitants of the dorm. Not this time though. So I brought a trash can here, along with trash bags, for us three to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; rule: if it&#39;s empty, put a bag in it. The bags are here. Right here, for everyone to take. Grab one. Put it in the can. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; throw trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She kept on throwing trash into a bare can. I talked to her. I told her, the bags are right there, put one in! She could take none of it. I didn&#39;t throw wet stuff! Those are all dry stuff that wouldn&#39;t stick to the can! What&#39;s wrong with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Km km. It is my trash can; you can follow my &lt;em&gt;one and only rule&lt;/em&gt; or I could just &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; let you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put the can on my table. It&#39;s mine now. Neither of you gets to use it. Actually I would&#39;ve let the third girl use it anyways since &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; didn&#39;t do anything wrong, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the maddening thing: she &lt;strong&gt;still threw stuff into the can anyways&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Not only behind my back, but also right in front of me, even!&lt;/strong&gt; She walked over to me desk, threw some shit in, muttering &amp;quot;I&#39;ll borrow this for a bit, thank you&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-19.html#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I carved her face out, my family won&#39;t have to buy extra food for a month. That&#39;s how thick her skin is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heated arguments; the dorm manager got involved; she was yelling, screaming incoherent bullshit — clearly on the defensive, which worked, since neither me nor the dorm manager could get a word in; and when she finally allowed our input she would cut into our speech about three characters in. The funniest thing was once she mentioned how I was constantly getting in fights with other dormmates, even before she shared a dorm with me — the third girl told her that! Which was funny on so many levels. She was the &amp;quot;new kid&amp;quot; and she dared talk about my past in front of the dorm manager, who had known me for two previous years? In addition, this was my first time sharing a dorm with the third girl too. This convinced me even more that she thinks we&#39;re all NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long while, even just thinking about her made my blood boil. Fortunately, sometimes she goes home to sleep. Unfortunately, it means every night is a surprise of &amp;quot;will she be here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something had to change. I used to think that there&#39;s only one semester left, so I could roll with it; and if I quit, or moved to another dorm, it would be me losing. She&#39;d win, and I&#39;d lose. Looking back, that was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; childish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I decided to move. There was an empty spot in a dorm full of my friends, so I moved there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of physical problems in that dorm. The door can&#39;t be closed properly and water keeps leaking out from mysterious places. But I am &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;. I am with my friends! I started looking forward to each night, instead of dreading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you&#39;ll excuse me sounding like a sloppy old cartoon moral narrator: sometimes we get in situations that make us uncomfortable and we just go with it, thinking we could handle it. Maybe its annoying dormmates, or maybe it could be a relationship we no longer wanna be in, etc. Move the hell out. There&#39;s got to be somewhere we can move to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, my longest post yet, a vent post. Venting sure is the muse of inspiration!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weird dreams I had</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html" />
    <updated>2025-04-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;details open=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Contents&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html#thoughts&quot;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t remember dreams that much, nor am I a lucid dreamer or something. But occasionally I remember a dream, and I write it down quickly. Here are some of them. They&#39;re usually really weird, so be warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time I dreamt that China was going to war with Turkey. On land. No idea how though. I was pushing one of those wheeled barbecue stands on the battlefield, and whenever Turkish soldiers got close enough, the BBQ stand would turn into a tank and knock them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dream it was explained extremely clearly why they were knocked away: because the tank was way bigger than a BBQ stand, the size increase shoved them away and accelerated them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the first time I had a dream within a dream. I woke up from the dream to post a Wechat moment post about it, but then I woke up for real on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice how in dreams, you don&#39;t figure out something, you just &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it and take the knowledge for granted? Like I didn&#39;t see anyone&#39;s faces, I don&#39;t know where I was, but I knew they were Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another time when I was sleeping in the car while my dad drove. I dreamt that he had me by the neck and was insistently telling me a story about how a man murdered all his subordinates one by one. Funniest thing was when I woke up, he asked me if I slept well. I answered, &amp;quot;okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long one. Bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with some goddamn &lt;em&gt;narration&lt;/em&gt;. This is a world where humans are incapable of understanding chemistry and biology. Just, plain intellectually incapable of studying them. The sky was a gloomy apocalyptic red and the trees were bare, and I was in jail. Not normal jail, but a prison for &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then a lot of things happened and I got out somehow, and I was in a school. I had to find someone. I was in a hallway with a window at the end not unlike my school IRL, and a student came out from a classroom. The sun was rising and he hadn&#39;t slept the entire night. A teacher came out after him, who had also stayed up the whole night, trying to figure something out to no avail, because humans are incapable of understanding anything related to chemistry and biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then a UFO hit the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the student saw two people by the lake, one of which was the guy I was looking for. I ran down to the lake, and met them as they walked towards the building. Someone was running with me, no idea who, but we were each given something that resembled food. I was about to eat it when my dad came, took it, and threw it into the lake. He took me away, saying &amp;quot;what was the 4th rule I taught you?&amp;quot; I couldn&#39;t remember. He said, &amp;quot;don&#39;t eat food given to you by strangers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked through a woods. He told me some thing about verification along the way, (I couldn&#39;t remember after waking up) and at the edge of the woods he said, &amp;quot;it&#39;s north up ahead. Keep walking and you&#39;ll reach Beijing.&amp;quot; I told him that it was south, and we had to turn back, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was north. I turned around and looked back into the woods. The apocalyptic red that was the backdrop of the entire dream up until this point was replaced by an eerie blue. I saw a policeman hiding behind a tree and peeking at me. My dad insisted that north was up ahead. I glanced at the policeman again and decided to just walk forward, realizing that he was right and that &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; indeed north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking on pavement now, and heard a gun being loaded behind me. I immediately threw up my hands, blabbering about how I did nothing wrong. The policeman from the woods walked past me, staring at me like I was an idiot, and I realized that he had not been following me at all and I was just overreacting. Still, he took me through a busy street and into a police station, where we went to the second floor, and he asked me to climb down a vertical ladder leading down to the busy street we just came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the second dream-within-a-dream I had. I woke up from that to me writing down the dream in my computer, but I ended up writing something about the life of a chef. And then I woke up for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UFO never came up a second time. It was a huge disk, crashing into the school grounds, and apparently nobody questioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a karaoke bar. I thought to myself, &amp;quot;now I know how to take off my pants,&amp;quot; because the last time I was here I didn&#39;t know how. Then I saw two white cats, so I scooped them up and hailed a taxi. The first driver didn&#39;t allow pets, so I hailed a second one. My mom was on there for some reason. We were going to find someone. The driver said, &amp;quot;let&#39;s go to the graduate school he attends.&amp;quot; Mom was surprised. &amp;quot;He&#39;s already working?&amp;quot; The driver lowered her voice and said, &amp;quot;he&#39;s the first to get red-checked&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never read too much upon how dreams reflect your inner state of mind or something, mainly because my dreams are so nonsensical, like these. What can you know about me from these dreams? I don&#39;t even know. Maybe except for the red-check thing. That obviously came from playing Werewolves too much.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thoughts: 1984</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-12.html" />
    <updated>2025-05-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-12.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An assortment of random thoughts I had regarding the book &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; by George Orwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there something wrong with me if I think the torture part is the most interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book struck me as extremely bland and unimaginative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jules Verne could imagine us shooting people to the moon with a cannon in 1865; but all Orwell, in 1948, could imagine happening in 1984 was basically 1948 stuff but with bad tobacco and bad alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the helicopter thing for example. A helicopter, flying out your window. Getting close enough to see inside. Seriously? Those are some damn amazing pilots then, able to fly so low, navigating apartment complexes without hitting a single thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s rework this. How does a huge chopper fly between buildings? It&#39;s a tiny chopper. How do people fit inside then? They don&#39;t. They control the tiny chopper from the ground. If there is no one inside, how do we spy on people? Attach a camera to the tiny chopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you just imagined up a drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we did was ask ourselves simple questions with simple answers. You see, this is not the hard part. The hardest question to answer is, &amp;quot;how do I portray totalitarian state surveillance?&amp;quot; Orwell answered it with &amp;quot;have helicopters fly out your window.&amp;quot; That is a decent answer. Now go a couple steps further and ask yourself the three questions I asked earlier. No, he didn&#39;t do it, resulting in a half-assed comedic chopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say, &amp;quot;why are you so preoccupied with tiny details? You&#39;re missing the point of the book!&amp;quot; What&#39;s the point of the book? The message? You can condense it into a single slogan, &amp;quot;totalitarianism bad.&amp;quot; You can write an essay. But this is a book. You&#39;re trying to craft a world that looks real. The world needs believable details to make it feel lived-in. This does not look real. The author described Winston&#39;s daily life pretty much, but for the vast majority of the people, the proles, we hardly get anything from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; perspective aside from Winston&#39;s own remarks, which, although can be taken as the author passing true information to us through him, paints them as collectively stupid and irrelevant. This is the farthest thing from a believable world. I cannot imagine anything similar happening in real life. So what&#39;s the point of warning us away from it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winston is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; likeable at all. He is a real fucking loser who fantasizes about beating and raping women. I can&#39;t root for him against the regime like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room 101. The most horrible place. Where they torture you into complete submission for real. Where they… dump a cageful of rats on your face. Look, I know it&#39;s supposed to be your worst fear. But imagine a grown-ass man whose greatest fear, the thing he fears more than anything else, more than fear itself, more than losing Julia… is… rats. Winston can&#39;t be real. Let&#39;s laugh at him. Call it the two-min humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; worst fear is, uh… eldritch horror. Or missing out. FOMO. What are they gonna do to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also what&#39;s wrong with clocks striking thirteen? Everyone should be using 24hr clocks. Tofu demands it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also reminded me of that New Concept English story where a clock was broken and this guy tried to fix it, but made it strike thirteen at one o&#39;clock instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bothered me so much that Minitrue, Minipax, and Miniluv all had 3 syllables, while Miniplenty had 4. He couldn&#39;t have went like, &amp;quot;Minimuch&amp;quot; or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside: since it&#39;s a book, there&#39;s no pronunciation provided, but I can&#39;t help imagining the stressed syllable to be the last one, e.g. mi-ni-TRUE. Gives it Uighur vibes. I&#39;ve yet to listen to an audiobook or something to see how other people pronounce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also bothered me a lot that &amp;quot;War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength&amp;quot; isn&#39;t ordered correctly. The society &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; war, slavery, and ignorance, and they want you to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you have peace, freedom, and strength; so it should&#39;ve been &amp;quot;slavery is freedom.&amp;quot; Again, it makes the book look really lazy. Because it fucking is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-min hate is really healthy, actually. It lets off your stress in a harmless way by directing your frustration towards someone you&#39;d never meet, instead of your wife and kids. Gives you a fresh start to the day, and wakes you up. I&#39;d love to yell at Vriska for two minutes every morning; if only everyone else would also be doing it with me so I wouldn&#39;t look like a lone idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the infodumping. Pages upon pages of infodumping where it&#39;s literally the contents of a book Winston is reading. Just go write an essay, please, at least then no one would&#39;ve convinced me to read this lame excuse of a book.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See, reading John le Carré paid off</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html" />
    <updated>2025-05-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or, my journey in espionage book land thus far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: this post contains a little spoilers for John le Carré&#39;s novels. I won&#39;t reveal anything big.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like spy novels, in case you haven&#39;t noticed. Not that I really read a lot. But my to-be-read list is strong and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started in the summer of 10th grade going into 11th. We had a reading assignment for AP Language, which was to choose one book from a list. One of them was &lt;em&gt;The Spy and the Traitor&lt;/em&gt; by Ben Macintyre. I was like, &amp;quot;hey, this looks nice!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was. That was when I found out that I loved these types of stories, tales of betrayal and paranoia and stuff. I read a couple more non-fiction books by Macintyre, like &lt;em&gt;A Spy Among Friends&lt;/em&gt; (about Kim Philby) and &lt;em&gt;Double Cross&lt;/em&gt; (about the deception campaign before the Normandy landing — oh Garbo, the OC creator to end all OC creators), but soon moved on to fiction ones. And how could anyone read spy novels without knowing about John le Carré?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who Came in From the Cold&lt;/em&gt;, which everyone recommended me to start with. It was great. I did not see it coming that twist at the end revealing how all the characters are just pawns being played around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I went to his first book, &lt;em&gt;Call for the Dead&lt;/em&gt;. Though people didn&#39;t like it as much, it was pretty great too in my opinion. Started from a mystery but later turned into a spy novel. The infodump at the end could&#39;ve been dealt with better, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I read &lt;em&gt;A Murder of Quality&lt;/em&gt;, which is still Smiley but a complete mystery with no spies inside. It was a little fuzzy for me, mostly because I didn&#39;t get how the murder was actually carried out; and besides, if I wanted to read great British mysteries I could just go for Agatha Christie or something. Speaking of whom, I had her Tommy and Tuppence series on my list too, because I heard that the third book in the series is a spy novel. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then came the Karla Trilogy. I will never forgive myself for dumbass googling too much about &lt;em&gt;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&lt;/em&gt; before I actually finished it and I GOT SPOILERED. I saw who the mole was. That was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fun. But even then, it was indeed a great book. Can&#39;t really say if I liked it any more than &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who&lt;/em&gt; though, but the spoiling had something to do with that. I also watched the 2011 movie but with terminal face-blindness I keep forgetting which actor was supposed to be who.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honourable&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Schoolboy&lt;/em&gt; was great too. Though the two hours I spent getting through the first chapter only to find that the entire chapter was just a bunch of journalists going mad and flipping into the Haven to find that the Circus had left Hong Kong was torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smiley&#39;s People&lt;/em&gt; wasn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; interesting in comparison. My main problem is how that guy they blackmailed (forgot his name, sorry) was a little too stupid, which watered it down a little. Still, it was a great and solid conclusion to the trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I went back to fill the standalone ones published before. &lt;em&gt;The Looking Glass War&lt;/em&gt;, published right after &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who&lt;/em&gt;, if I remembered correctly, made people say &amp;quot;oh, so he&#39;s the kind of author who wrote &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; good book and the rest are all bad.&amp;quot; I think it&#39;s underrated though. It&#39;s basically &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who&lt;/em&gt; with its themes amplified. I could imagine, if you asked le Carré &amp;quot;why do you hate your job&amp;quot; or something, he&#39;d say, &amp;quot;well lemme tell you a little story&amp;quot; and give this book to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Small Town in Germany&lt;/em&gt; was amazing too. &amp;quot;I&#39;ll chase you and you chase me and each of us will chase ourselves.&amp;quot; (It went something like that I just recalled from memory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Drummer Girl&lt;/em&gt; was the last book I read. Took me quite a while to finish, but not because it was boring. Charlie&#39;s motivation to spy was a little hard to understand though. My favorite part about it was first when I figured out Kurtz&#39;s plan after intercepting Salim at the border. Which, may or may not be explained in the book and I may or may not be right, but it looks smart. Another favorite part was how everyone seems an actor on a stage, playing different parts under different names. Charlie, who was already an actor in the first place; Joseph was Michael and Becker; Kurtz could turn into Schumann and whoever he was in front of Ned and the British police (I forgot his name).&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be starting on &lt;em&gt;A Perfect Spy&lt;/em&gt; next. I honestly can&#39;t rank these books because I don&#39;t want to put any one near the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I heard that le Carré&#39;s son is going to continue writing about Smiley. I hope he&#39;s good. &lt;em&gt;Angelmaker&lt;/em&gt; is on my list, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to it. On one hand I&#39;m happy to get more books, but on the other, I&#39;m worried that he&#39;s gonna turn it into some cheesy franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, the frustration that always came with someone used to reading kids books reading something from the last century. A lot of language was hard to understand, and my reading time and comprehension was greatly impacted because of that. But that&#39;s already way better than those 1700&#39;s poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have to read in bed, or I couldn&#39;t even fall asleep. I&#39;d been on my phone more lately, which is why I haven&#39;t been reading as much, and why it took me so long to finish &lt;em&gt;The Little Drummer Girl&lt;/em&gt;. Throughout high school, all I ever read were &lt;em&gt;Wings of Fire&lt;/em&gt; and John le Carré. Required reading in class don&#39;t count; I only read summaries of those. I did absolutely 0 preparation for the AP Lit test, and I rested all my bets on the last essay prompt being able to fit some le Carré book. One of the past prompts I saw was about dramatic irony. Damn, &lt;em&gt;The Looking Glass War&lt;/em&gt; was full of it. &lt;em&gt;Drummer Girl&lt;/em&gt; too. In the actual test, the prompt was about a character losing something and how they reacted. Damn! I wrote about &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who&lt;/em&gt; and how Leamas lost Riemeck&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Liz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay was downright terrible, I had no logic, and I forgot about the entire thing where Leamas hit Ford and went to jail. But it was better than the previous two. I&#39;m flunking the test. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had read some books by other authors too, like &lt;em&gt;Our Man in Havana&lt;/em&gt; by Graham Greene, which kind of inspired me to make a TIR story like that but in the perspective of a hapless guy targeted by whatever country&#39;s equivalent of the KGB. But I didn&#39;t have any ideas past that, so whatever. And &lt;em&gt;Fatherland&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Harris, which was really neat. And there&#39;s the category of &amp;quot;I have no idea what happened in them and I haven&#39;t gotten around to rereading it,&amp;quot; which includes &lt;em&gt;The Ipcress File&lt;/em&gt; by Len Deighton and &lt;em&gt;Gorky Park&lt;/em&gt; by Martin Cruz Smith&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And some others. Most of these definitely deserve rereading, especially &lt;em&gt;The Ipcress File&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gorky Park&lt;/em&gt; since I read them but it was like I didn&#39;t at all, but I just have so many more on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And true to my nature I also tried to find books written for kids, because you will want to read some of those after reading something like, IDK, most of the books mentioned above.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I found &lt;em&gt;Spy School&lt;/em&gt; by Stuart Gibbs, and after enjoying maybe like the first five books and reading the rest simply out of inertia (and their synopsis are really catchy. If only as much thought is put into the actual contents of the books), I found out how the author is a total piece of shit and finally set my mind to ditch it. I&#39;d still recommend the first book though, and only the first. I had also read some other series by the same author, mysteries rather than espionage, and they were to some extent enjoyable I guess. Still, he was pretty much ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;d think I would&#39;ve learned to move on from middle grade books after that, but no; I shall never learn a lesson. I found this other series, &lt;em&gt;City Spies&lt;/em&gt; by James Ponti, and I started on the third book just because it mentioned China (they spent most of their time in Russia though) and it actually proved to be pretty great. Way better than whatever pile of garbage &lt;em&gt;Spy School&lt;/em&gt; was. So into the list the series went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I also saw &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Smith&#39;s Spy School for Girls&lt;/em&gt;. Gave up after one chapter. It sounds like it&#39;s written by a middle schooler.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something captivating about espionage. The feeling of worldviews being formed around lies and half-truths, the drama of betrayal, an almost artistically beautiful portrayal of paranoia, who&#39;s in the light and who&#39;s in the dark, the struggle to gain control while falling into powerlessness, and the strategy of nations battling each other in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&#39;ll be back later with more books. I&#39;m a horrible reader and writer so I don&#39;t end up having a lot to say about every book, but things turn long if I review a bunch of books in one post.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Translation: Mosuo Legends</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-07-16.html" />
    <updated>2025-07-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-07-16.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Mosuo are a matriarchal society mostly residing in Sichuan and Yunnan, China. I liked their legend of creation a lot, so I made a translation of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original texts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NNU9hT8yjlwxZZstlnJX5A&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;【芭纳木】摩梭民间故事：先祖路依若&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-zLg0pTiav4QddXzzXOOqA&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;【芭纳木】摩梭民间故事：人犬换寿&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnings for typical legend illogicality and absurdness! In addition, nearly all of them are orally passed down and inconsistencies may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long, long time ago, the ancestor of the Mosuo people Luyiruo and his little brother lived a peaceful life of farming. They didn&#39;t know that a disaster would soon come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brothers were farming as usual when a crow circled above their heads, cawing. Luyiruo&#39;s little brother was heartless; he grabbed a fistful of dirt and threw it at the crow, thinking that its cawing meant bad luck. Luyiruo, however, was very caring. He didn&#39;t chase the crow away, but instead asked it what it wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crow told them, &amp;quot;a flood is coming, one that will wipe out all life on land. You need to be prepared. Slaughter two sheep, make sacks from their skins, tie them to a tree, and hide inside. That&#39;s the only way you can survive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crow instructed the little brother to sew his sack with a thick needle and thin thread, and to tie it to the trunk of the tree; while it instructed Luyiruo to sew his with a thin needle and thick thread, and to tie it to the tip of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brothers did as the crow told them. The flood came. It drowned over the little brother&#39;s sack first, and the water leaked inside; he drowned soon after, paying for his heartless actions. Luyiruo&#39;s waterproof sack floated above the water; he survived because of his kindness. After a long time, the flood ceased, and Luyiruo got out of his sheep skin sack. When he landed on the ground, the vast plains were devoid of life. He was the only one left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lonely life was miserable. Luyiruo prayed to gods all the time, praying for a partner who could sing and dance with him. So the Sky God sent down the God of Life, Abado. Abado came with a rhododendron branch, carved it into a little person and gave it to Luyiruo, saying, &amp;quot;bury this in the soil. Seven years later, it will grow into a partner who can sing and dance with you.&amp;quot; Rhododendrons are sacred trees, and this is why the Mosuo use them in rituals. Luyiruo heard &amp;quot;seven years,&amp;quot; knelt down and begged it to be faster, or he would die of loneliness. Abado agreed, and changed it to seven months — but not a minute less, because all good things need time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luyiruo buried the little wooden figure into the soil and waited around it every day. On the seventh day, he couldn&#39;t wait any longer, and dug the figure out to see how it was growing. The figure could move its toes and chin now, but it was far from a real human. Luyiruo got mad. &amp;quot;You will never actually turn into someone who could sing and dance with me!&amp;quot; With that, he threw it far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luyiruo&#39;s actions had enraged Abado, so he couldn&#39;t rely on them anymore. He had to seek new options. He decided that he would find someone from the sky. With great effort, this brave human being arrived at the Sky Kingdom. He reached a well, and, being so tired, sat down to have a drink. Just then, the Eldest Sky Daughter came to get water, and ran into him. Her eyes were vertical, and she was brilliantly smart. The Eldest Sky Daughter asked him where he came from and what he wanted to do. He answered honestly. The Sky Daughter was so happy, because she always thought that the ground was better than the sky, where everything was really boring. She saw her opportunity to go live on the land, and agreed enthusiastically to help Luyiruo out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eldest Sky Daughter knew that her father would not let Luyiruo have it easy, so she went back first and stole the ring on her father&#39;s thumb and had Luyiruo put it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sky God got the message that someone wanted to marry one of his daughters. He thought that this person must be brave, and decided to test him. He called the man forth, and set a tiger on him. The tiger saw one of the Sky God&#39;s belongings on Luyiruo, and backed down. The Sky God then let the leopard out, who also backed down. The Sky God set all of the most vicious animals on Luyiruo, but they all scattered away. The Sky God realized that Luyiruo was no ordinary man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day, the Sky God said to Luyiruo, &amp;quot;so you want to marry one of my daughters to sing and dance with you? That&#39;s okay, but you have to pass all my tests first. Go cut down all the trees on the mountain!&amp;quot; Luyiruo went to the mountain, but he only cut down three trees before collapsing. The Eldest Sky Daughter came to his aid. She told him, &amp;quot;start from the bottom, and slice one mark into each tree. Finally, just cut down the tree at the top.&amp;quot; Luyiruo did as she said. When the topmost tree fell, all the other trees fell one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sky God then ordered him to burn down the mountain so crops can be planted. Luyiruo spent a lot of time lighting just three fires. When he was complaining about how hard it was, the Eldest Sky Daughter came to his aid again. &amp;quot;It&#39;s not hard,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;pile up the wood first, and light up the pile at the bottom.&amp;quot; Luyiruo did as she said. When the bottommost fire was lit, the fire burned all the way to the top. Soon, the entire mountain was cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the Sky God ordered him to plant buckwheat. He gave him three &lt;em&gt;sheng&lt;/em&gt; of buckwheat, and told him to grow thirty-three &lt;em&gt;dan&lt;/em&gt; from it. The mountain was so big, how could he plant all of those seeds and harvest thirty-three &lt;em&gt;dan&lt;/em&gt;? Luyiruo was stuck again. The Sky Daughter appeared again and taught him a spell. Luyiruo chanted the spell while scattering the seeds, and soon all the seeds were planted. The buckwheat was ready for harvest. Luyiruo took all thirty-three &lt;em&gt;dan&lt;/em&gt; to the Sky God, but he insisted that a little bit was missing. The Eldest Sky Daughter told him that the Sky God sent a pigeon and ate a little bit. He had to kill the pigeon to get it back. She gave him a bow and some arrows from the Sky Kingdom. Luyiruo was worried that he would miss. He stood near the Sky Daughter&#39;s loom and hesitated to shoot. The Sky Daughter panicked and threw the shuttle his way, hitting his arm and letting the arrow loose. It hit the pigeon. Luyiruo got the remaining buckwheat from inside the pigeon&#39;s belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sky God was difficult. He set up more tests for Luyiruo. This time, he had to get some tiger milk. Who dared get near the vicious tiger? Luyiruo was troubled, but he still decided to carry on. In a shrub, he saw a weasel with cubs, and got some weasel milk to fool the Sky God. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. No other animal reacted, but all the chicken ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with weasel milk, and ordered him to go looking again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, he met a wolf with cubs. He took back some wolf milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, no other animal reacted, but all the pigs ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with wolf milk, and ordered him to go looking again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third time, he met a leopard with cubs. He took back some leopard milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, no other animal reacted, but all the horses ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with leopard milk, and told him that if he couldn&#39;t get tiger milk next time, he would have to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this crucial moment, the Eldest Sky Daughter appeared again. She told him, &amp;quot;the tiger&#39;s nest is under the rocks at the mountaintop. When it&#39;s snowing, the mother will go out to hunt. You need to kill a tiger cub, wear its pelt, and play with the other cubs. Act like them as much as possible, and when the mother comes back, you can get tiger milk.&amp;quot; She also gave him a pig&#39;s bladder to put the milk in. Luyiruo did as she said, and successfully brought back tiger milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, every animal ran away. Luyiruo&#39;s tests were finally complete, and he can now take a Sky Daughter home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sky God turned his daughters into vicious animals and had them run towards Luyiruo. Whoever he could catch would be the one to sing and dance with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eldest Sky Daughter turned into a tiger and ran out. Luyiruo freaked out and failed to catch her. She helped him this whole way, but it ended like this; what a great pity. The Second Sky Daughter turned into a leopard and leapt out. Luyiruo was still scared, and failed to catch her. The Youngest Sky Daughter turned into a boa and flew at him. Luyiruo thought, &lt;em&gt;this is my last chance&lt;/em&gt;, and closed his eyes, reaching out, grabbing hold of the boa&#39;s tail. The boa turned back into the Youngest Sky Daughter. Her eyes were horizontal like ours, because we&#39;re descended from her. People often said that if Luyiruo married the vertical-eyed Eldest, we would be a lot smarter, and could live life a lot easier. But it was the Sky&#39;s will that we shall struggle to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like that, Luyiruo found a partner and went back to the land to live. The Sky God gave many gifts to them, like grains, plants, and farm animals. Originally, the Sky God didn&#39;t give us the cat, but it snuck down and helped us catch mice, so we treat cats like gods too. The Sky God also didn&#39;t give us delicious oatmeal, but the Youngest Sky Daughter hid some in her pubes. This is why we don&#39;t use oatmeal in rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before they left, the Sky God reminded them, &amp;quot;no matter how much land you have, it will be rife with weeds if no one takes care of it; no matter how many animals you have, they will be hunted and die if no one guards them; no matter how big your house is, it will be destroyed by wind and rain if no one maintains it.&amp;quot; Luyiruo learnt the words of his father-in-law by heart and returned to the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple planted crops and fed animals, living a life full of hope. The land was full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eldest Sky Daughter was sad and jealous because she didn&#39;t fulfil her own wishes. She came down to the land to get revenge on her little sister and her husband. They had planted a large swathe of barley in front of their home. The Eldest Sky Daughter turned into a deer and ate all the barley. The Youngest knew it was her big sister&#39;s doing, and ordered Luyiruo to get out his bow and arrows and shoot the deer. Luyiruo didn&#39;t want to do so, and the Youngest did it herself. She tucked her dress onto her waist and ran outside with the bow. Luyiruo, not wanting to hurt the Eldest, snatched the bow and shot, purposefully only hitting a hoof. The deer ran away, leaving a trail of blood. Luyiruo chased after her. The Eldest lured Luyiruo far away, mountain after mountain, until they reached a spring. She revealed her true form, said farewell, and tricked Luyiruo into drinking the spring water, which made him fall into a deep sleep. Only then did the Eldest leave them be and return to the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Youngest was waiting for Luyiruo back home. She waited for years. There was a monkey on the mountain who wanted to marry the Youngest Sky Daughter. He saw his chance and came to her, saying he could help her find Luyiruo, but he didn&#39;t have shoes. She made him a pair of grass shoes, but he only took a few steps before it wore down and he returned. She made him another pair with iron. The monkey scrubbed it against a rock until it wore down too, and he returned again. The Youngest Sky Daughter was dejected, and simply decided to just marry the monkey. They had a lot of little monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades passed with Luyiruo sleeping by the spring. An autumn frost woke him. He drank some water from the spring, and saw in the reflection that his hair had gone gray. He walked home on a crotch, and seeing the monkey there, he got mad and killed the monkey. The little monkeys are the Youngest Sky Daughter&#39;s children, so he kept them. But he thought all the fur on the monkeys were ugly, so he boiled a pot of water and burned the fur off them. The little monkeys covered their heads and ran, so the fur on their heads, armpits, and pubic areas was untouched, which is why we grow fur on these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, Luyiruo and the Youngest Sky Daughter lived together peacefully. They worked, sang, danced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a problem. Everyone was immortal; no one would die. Pretty soon, the land was overcrowded. The Sky God thought that all life should both start and end. He sent the God of Life, Abado, to assign an age to all life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abado came down to land again. They first gave all plants an age, and moved on to the animals. He secretly sent a dream to Luyiruo to listen close and claim a long age for humans. But he overslept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abado yelled, &amp;quot;a thousand!&amp;quot; The alert crane answered their call, so the crane got the longest age. Abado then yelled, &amp;quot;a hundred!&amp;quot; The aware duck answered their call, and got a hundred years, went away shaking its duck butt. Abado went on assigning ages while Luyiruo was still sleeping at home. When they reached sixty, the smart dog answered, and got sixty years. They got all the way to thirteen when Luyiruo snapped awake and hastily answered. This is how humans were doomed to die at thirteen because we liked sleeping too much. Luyiruo turned to walk home sadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abado chased after him and told him, &amp;quot;why don&#39;t you talk to the dog? They&#39;re the closest animals to humans. Maybe you can trade!&amp;quot; Luyiruo thought, &lt;em&gt;true. Ever since I came back with the Youngest Sky Daughter, the dog had followed loyally by my side. It guarded my home and animals, kept the elderly in company, and gave the young joy. Surely, it will agree?&lt;/em&gt; So he said goodbye to Abado, found the dog, and asked to trade ages with it. The dog thought, &lt;em&gt;even though I spent a lot of effort getting these sixty years, I rely on humans a lot.&lt;/em&gt; It agreed, but under these three conditions: first, humans must never harm dogs; second, during holidays, after rituals, humans have to feed the dogs first before they can start; third, when dogs die, they have to be buried in the yard with a sack of bones. Luyiruo agreed to these conditions with gratitude. He thought about another animal equally loyal to humans — the cat, who snuck down from the sky to help humans, so he added cats to the same conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, humans can live to sixty years. This is also why the Mosuo hold their adulting ceremony at thirteen years old, because the new life that dogs gave us have started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice how the Second Sky Daughter only appeared once? The second child syndrome is truly a staple of humanity LOL.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ethnicity or whatever</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-03.html" />
    <updated>2025-08-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-03.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen a lot of people (or maybe not a lot and I&#39;m just overreacting) mix up ethnicity (民族) and place of origin (籍贯) when it comes to Chinese people, when these two things are entirely separate concepts. And well I want to ramble about it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re mostly all Han. An overwhelming majority. That&#39;s ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone says they&#39;re a &amp;quot;Hunan person&amp;quot; or whatever, they&#39;re referring to their place of origin, a geographical divide. It usually refers to where your grandpa&#39;s grandpa&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-03.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; had been living all these generations, but since a lot of people can&#39;t really trace it back that far (or had kept moving), maybe three or four generations would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, for one: my mom&#39;s from Hebei and my dad&#39;s from Hunan. That makes my place of origin Hunan&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-03.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1:1&quot;&gt;[1:1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I can&#39;t half-and-half that since it&#39;s not ethnicity and only ethnicity can be mixed&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-03.html#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I grew up in Shenzhen&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-03.html#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I had hardly ever stepped foot in Hunan; I can&#39;t speak the dialect and I can&#39;t tolerate spicy food to save my life, but no matter where I move to I&#39;d still be &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; Hunan. (It kinda gives the same vibes as &amp;quot;my papa&#39;s papa is my grandpa.&amp;quot;) On the ethnicity side, we&#39;re all Han.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographical divides can&#39;t function as ethnic divides because there is no clearly distinct cultural identity across those province borders. Regional differences in dialects or cuisine exist, but they don&#39;t amount to separate ethnic identities; and current province borders do not reflect those regional divides enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, ethnicity and place of origin are two separate categories. A person with a certain place of origin may as well be of any ethnicity, and vice versa. For some OC-making advice, you can mix and match those to your heart&#39;s content because they&#39;re separate categories and technically speaking any combination works (though certain ethnicities are prominent in certain areas and it would be a little weird if you said they&#39;re from somewhere too far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Game: Henry Stickmin</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-13.html" />
    <updated>2025-08-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-13.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Choose-your-own-adventure game where failing is even more fun than succeeding. I was playing those old Flash games on 4399 since elementary school. The Henry Stickmin Collection, released a lot later, was also great; though some routes in Completing the Mission weren&#39;t as fun and felt rushed. My favorite game is Fleeing the Complex, favorite route Presumed Dead, favorite track Complex Waltz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I loved about this game in terms of CYOA was that it doesn&#39;t feature useless choices like &amp;quot;go left or go right?&amp;quot; The closest example I can think of was in the Triple Threat route in Completing the Mission with &amp;quot;Henry&#39;s plan,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ellie&#39;s plan,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Charles&#39;s plan.&amp;quot; But that is based on the fact that we already know enough about the characters at this point; and especially with Charles&#39;s great track record of coming up with perfect plans we can get a sense of what each character would do, so it wasn&#39;t a blind random choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither does it feature choices that changes an NPC&#39;s stats like their affection towards you or anything — like come on that&#39;s an RPG thing; what&#39;s it doing in my beloved CYOA?? I hate character stat management, let alone NPC stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither does it feature binary &amp;quot;do this or don&#39;t do this?&amp;quot; choices unless in branching points like whether to rescue Ellie in Fleeing the Complex, and even then both these choices lead to their own endings. Most of the choices is not &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you want to do, but rather &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; do you accomplish this thing you definitely want to do. With a clear goal in mind, you choose your method of achieving it, with one success and the rest being failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of each choice is clearly all well-thought out. Fail scenes are funny and I&#39;d argue an even more important part of the game than the plot itself — which is really childish (the government hiring some random outlaw to take down in exchange for freedom a gangster group flying a giant aircraft in the country&#39;s airspace? They&#39;re flying in your airspace just get the military to blast them into smithereens already), though not as much considering the developer made most of them when he was really young IIRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, great game. This is the greatest plan~~&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I traveled a bit during the summer, yet never wrote about any of it out of procrastination. I&#39;m doing all of it together here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details open=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Contents&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#yunnan&quot;&gt;Yunnan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#kunming&quot;&gt;Kunming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#dali&quot;&gt;Dali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#xinjiang&quot;&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#urumqi&quot;&gt;Urumqi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#altay&quot;&gt;Altay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#ili&quot;&gt;Ili&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#urumqi-again&quot;&gt;Urumqi again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#hebei&quot;&gt;Hebei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;yunnan&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Yunnan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three of us originally planned to go, just us three, together. But right before leaving, Sue found that she had a broken bone on her ankle that needed an operation. So yeah, she&#39;s stuck hospitalized. The parents of the two of us left weren&#39;t confident in allowing two girls to go out alone, so Selena&#39;s mom tagged along with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked in way too late on the plane so I&#39;m stuck in some middle seat. The people to my left and right seemed like a boss and one of his employees out on business. I think when they chose their seats, they left a gap between them so they could have more space. Sorry for barging in the middle, LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kunming&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Kunming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stay in Kunming was great. The owner decorated the little yard with a bunch of flowers and had some koi in the little stream. It also got a water wheel, where both Selena and I had tried to do a Reverse: 1999 pull with unsatisfying results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the National Southwestern Associated University museum, which Selena was very interested in. After that, we went to the Green Lake and saw a lot of birds, kitties, and bamboos thicker than my leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20bamboo.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don&#39;t like taking pictures, and I changed to a new phone recently, so I&#39;ll be posting whatever pictures I can scrouge up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening, we went to a steam pot chicken place. It was great. Way better than whatever demon chicken soup they make in Guangdong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we walked along the Haigeng dam. We saw this guy writing stuff on the floor. I guess I&#39;d be meeting more of these people if I went out often instead of rotting in my room all day, but he was impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20writing.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dali&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Dali&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we went to Dali. Originally we were going to Lijiang because Sue already went to Dali before, but now that she&#39;s not here we decided to not risk the altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of halal restaurants in Dali, and apparently there are a lot of Hui people here, despite the main people being Bai. We went past a mosque in the taxi, but didn&#39;t go in. I was surprised that it looked just like any other ancient Chinese temple; not a trace of Arabic-ness or anything. Then it occurred to me that this was probably really old and people had no idea what Arabic architecture looked like back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the Cang mountain up the cableway. We were batshit scared, especially when the carrier went past a pole and the entire thing jolted. But we came out alive. We spent a lot of time near the pond, which had crystal-clear icy cold water. We tried climbing up but after barely a minute I felt blood in my throat and Selena said to turn back too. So up we gave. There&#39;s a little store selling milk tea made with pond water and we each bought a cup. It was the best milk tea I&#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also biked around Erhai Lake. We saw a little girl with her dad, learning to read. She was really cute&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-15.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. She&#39;s holding a stack of cards, each with a character on it. She&#39;d take a card, show it to her dad, and ask him, &amp;quot;do you know how to pronounce this?&amp;quot; Her dad would pretend to not know, or purposefully give a wrong answer. &amp;quot;I don&#39;t know, is it… you?&amp;quot; And the girl would correct him, &amp;quot;no, it&#39;s pi! As in banana peel!&amp;quot; And her dad would say &amp;quot;ahh, you&#39;re so smart.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also fell for a candy fruit prank. We bought something called &amp;quot;idiot fruit&amp;quot; because anyone who buys it is an idiot; it&#39;s sold specifically to tourists who&#39;ve never seen it before. We ended up throwing the bag away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also went to the Chongsheng Temple, the one with the three pagodas. They were giving out stamps, so we both got one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20stamp%20paper.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a gigantic white marble stamp, so big it took both people to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20stamp.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also the &amp;quot;frog rock,&amp;quot; where if you bump a rock against it, you can hear a frog croak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20frog%20rock.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ar first, we didn&#39;t find the sound to be different from plain old rock-bumping; but later we realized it was not the rock itself, but the &lt;em&gt;echo&lt;/em&gt;, that sounded like a frog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back to Kunming for the plane back home. The last night&#39;s stay was pretty horrible; my fault for being cheap. We had steam pot chicken again in Kunming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;xinjiang&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Xinjiang. My travel philosophy is that scenery can all be seen online, and only food goes into your stomach and becomes truly yours. I had noodles, naan, baked buns, big plate chicken, and meat pies. 10/10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of my mom&#39;s happened to have planned a trip with her sister, and my mom and I tagged along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;urumqi&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Urumqi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rendezvoused at Urumqi. Since my mom and I arrived a lot earlier than the others, the guide took us to a local kebab place he knew. The kebab was nice; they served free milk tea the way eastern restaurants served free barley tea. &lt;em&gt;Real&lt;/em&gt; milk tea, mind you, not whatever abomination modern bubble tea is. It was way too salty for me. After the others had arrived, we went to the Grand Bazaar that night to eat whatever we come across. I just had a baked bun and spent the entire trip blowing at it because it was too hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we went to Tianshan Heaven Lake. Out of the six of us, three didn&#39;t like taking photos and the other three loved it, so us three were always way ahead of the other three. I had some naan while waiting for them. Chewing it too hard hurts your jaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;altay&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Altay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xinjiang is one of those travel places where you spend more time on the road than actually touring. We went all the way to Burqin to the Rainbow Beach. It was made that way because all sorts of metals somehow got to the surface of the rocks. Red for iron, green for copper, stuff like that. My mom complained that the picture I took of her made her look too ugly. But that&#39;s just how she looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed at Jiadengyu, a sort of crossroads to Kanas and Hemu that everyone who visits these places have to stay in. We saw a llama. It feels really nice, I wish you were there to pet it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20llama.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also loaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20llama%20loaf.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a restaurant we also saw a litter of Jianzhou cats playing with each other. Their mom had abandoned them, according to the restaurant owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20cats.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them even flipped its belly at me. By the time we finished eating and got out, they got tired and got into a heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20cats%20tired.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ili&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Ili&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went south. We passed through the &amp;quot;devil city,&amp;quot; which was nothing but heat and rocks and was pretty boring. We also passed through Karamay, and you can smell the sulfur from inside the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jinghe county, we had some meat pies at a place called &amp;quot;Running Meat Pies.&amp;quot; It was great. 10/10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to Sayram Lake and drove around it. I saw a ladybug spread its wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/travel%20summer%202025%20ladybug.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some nearby horse ranch we saw a Kazakh kid fluidly climb up a horse. He wasn&#39;t even tall enough; he had to park the horse near a fence and step onto the fence. Bro couldn&#39;t have been older than eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to Horgos, on the Kazakhstan border. We originally wanted to get into the China-Kazakhstan collaboration zone where you can buy cigarettes and wine for cheap, but none of us brought our passports and the place they hand out temporary passes was closed twenty minutes before we got there. I ended up getting some Russian sausage, chocolate, and ice cream, the last of which definitely contributed to the period cramps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we got to Narati. My period came and I spent the day in bed while they rode horses. Well fuck me in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there we went on Duku Highway. There are a lot of groundhogs to the side. They had big butts. Sometimes they stand up and fight each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;urumqi-again&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Urumqi again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey&#39;s almost at an end. The guide took us to a local restaurant. You can tell it&#39;s really local when most of the waiters barely speak Mandarin. When I asked him to make the big plate chicken not spicy, he stared at me like I was an idiot for a while (maybe something like &amp;quot;big plate chicken not spicy? Why don&#39;t I give you ice cream not cold?&amp;quot; or maybe he just didn&#39;t understand me) and when the chicken was served it was still spicy. And then there are a couple of dancers dancing around the place. Do Uyghurs just have to watch people dance to stomach their food or something? Did the restaurant hire them specifically just to dance? Or they&#39;re all just waiters taking dancing shifts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we visited Xinjiang Museum, but exhibits 1 - 6 were all closed and we didn&#39;t get to see the dried corpse it was famous for. And then home we went. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to go to southern Xinjiang one day; I&#39;d really like to visit Kashgar, and also have big plate chicken and meat pies again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hebei&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Hebei&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to my mom&#39;s hometown to visit some relatives before I leave. On the way there we chose a 21-hour train ride. You need to go through double security at the train station now if your train passes through Beijing, even though we were supposed to get off before then. We played card games. Dad won all but two rounds (which I won) because he could actually calculate what cards we had left based on what we had played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fucheng, one of my mom&#39;s friends lent us her house to stay in and her car to go places. I ate too much at my little aunt&#39;s (she made me two big pots of dumplings) and had a stomachache. Later, we went to Langfang, to my third aunt&#39;s. We had some great lamb hotpot. I finished Type Help over there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I&#39;m departing for the US</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-28.html" />
    <updated>2025-08-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-28.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t until when I was buying plane tickets and changing the default &amp;quot;round-trip&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;one-way,&amp;quot; that it occurred to me: I was leaving for good. It would be four whole years before I&#39;d get back again. (Unless I graduate early LMAO.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the United States, where people eat broccoli raw (and complain that it tastes bad) and pack peas inside bags to put on their forehead when they have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much the first time I&#39;ve traveled alone so far away. I&#39;m ready to make a Twilight Sparkle-style checklist of all the things I need to do. How do I find my transfer plane? Or which conveyor belt my luggage went to? How to check them in again at San Francisco? What if I fuck up and got stranded in, IDK, Detroit?? What if they send me back at the customs? What if I ran into an emergency and had to call my parents but they&#39;re asleep and didn&#39;t answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d much rather cuddle in my mom&#39;s lap forever but I know that one day I&#39;m going to have to live without them, whether because I&#39;ve grown up or we&#39;re separated by another kind of one-way ticket. I&#39;d much rather go through the former first. At least I can call them and message them, and they can come over during the summer. They even had instructions for me to rent a small place with one bedroom so they can sleep in the bedroom while I can fuck off on the sofa or something, provided that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a sofa. I need to rent a place regardless; the dorms close during the holidays. Like c&#39;mon, why? My parents aren&#39;t letting me go back during the summer either, because &amp;quot;all they do is lie in their beds and waste their lives when they could&#39;ve been doing internships or taking courses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like, who doesn&#39;t want to lie in her bed all day?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five days in the US</title>

    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-08-31.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been exhausting. I&#39;ve been going to bed before midnight and sleeping until seven these days; and while that&#39;s certainly healthy, it also proves how tired I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news. The trip was okay. I got here without losing a lot of stuff. (Except that one clothes hanger that broke. IDEK when or where; probably during one of the flights or when I dragged the bag down the conveyor belt?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a lot of new student events. Everyone is so… energetic here. I mean, they acted that way when I was in elementary school, but I assumed it was because we were kids, so the adults want to appear fun. But now, as college students, they still act like that. All the hype, all the cheering, all the socializing… most of the time it&#39;s too loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Sunday, and finally there is nothing going on. (Actually there is, but I just decided to skip on them.) I&#39;m in the dorm on my computer, my roommate is on her computer; life is perfect like this. I have been experiencing an extreme lack of motivation in doing paracosming, but I&#39;ve grown to know that certain types of stress can do that. Hopefully when classes start I can settle into a routine I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The socializing! Day 234 of dreaming to immigrate to Moreland. It&#39;s like the entire world is hostile to introverts and the only way to ever be a part of society is to turn yourself into an extrovert. Why do people like going to lunch / dinner in a huge-ass group anyways? Dining is such a personal thing. I just want to get my food and chew on it alone, no talking. It scares me that I&#39;m bound to have to deal with a lot of people eventually, and even to GO TO other people and TALK to them to try to get them interested in ME. Like what the fuck! How the fuck am I supposed to do that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also all the water is freezing cold here. I had to buy a kettle for warmer water. I remember when I was a kid I saw this girl putting a slab of ice in her water bottle, explaining that if she finished drinking, the ice would melt and she would have more water to drink. It sounded so stupid to me, because ice has a lower density than water so she&#39;s essentially getting less water in the same-sized bottle. But thinking back, she would probably have less water than have room-temperature water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the irony of having the most free time during the weekends, yet everything is closed. I&#39;ve yet to open a bank account and mail that package to a friend. Hopefully I can get those done by next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I&#39;ve just heard about Blaugust today, as someone posted about it ending. Maybe I can join next year. I have a hard time coming up with things to write about, so hopefully that can be a motivator.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One week of college</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-06.html" />
    <updated>2025-09-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-06.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a week. Well, I fucking hate college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically it wasn&#39;t even a week. It&#39;s 4 days since we had Monday off. But it felt like an eternity. Most of my classes are just full of reading assignments and discussions and the likes. Makes me question my sanity. I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to take some math next semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have two online classes. Why did I fly all the way here just to attend &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; courses?? One of them has an in-person period each week, but the other is purely online. But! The purely online one locks future modules and only releases one each week, so you can&#39;t rush through all of them at the start either. Why the fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve played &lt;em&gt;Return of the Obra Dinn&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;ve known it for a while, but the art style and the 3D put me off a lot. Well, I tried it, and I can&#39;t say I liked it. For all my love of mystery puzzle games, I can&#39;t play them at all, and have to consult a walkthrough with every little thing. But I also don&#39;t like the supernatural elements in there. I&#39;m fine with supernatural &lt;em&gt;investigating&lt;/em&gt;, like going into memory of the last moments of a corpse, but when the &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; to the mysteries contains supernatural elements, I can&#39;t say I like it. I&#39;d much prefer everything to be grounded in reality. &lt;em&gt;Obra Dinn&lt;/em&gt; was like this; so was &lt;em&gt;Type Help&lt;/em&gt;. But at least Type Help was easier. So yeah, Obra Dinn isn&#39;t going on the media list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll spare you the freaking out about being alone, mostly because I can&#39;t really articulate my thoughts right now, but know that I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; indeed freaking out about being alone and uncertain of the future. I have no idea what I&#39;m going to do and more importantly if I can do it, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever have an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>让我们说中文</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-10.html" />
    <updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-10.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;我一直不咋用中文写东西。要问为啥，原因我倒是能讲清楚。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先就是初中语文课真是把我燃尽了。八百字和八百米真是能害死人的两条天际线，一个物理上，一个心灵上（手臂也算物理吧）。各种令我怀疑人生的作文题，绞尽脑汁地想怎么把现有的素材套上去，反反复复地写着各种幼稚可笑的话语……似乎写作的唯一目的就是能让阅卷老师的眉毛往上抬抬，打个高分。反观英文，到高中前都没有真正地写过东西。那些不到一百词的英语作文都不算东西，翻译题干就完事了。我用英文写的东西都是自己真心喜欢的文字，比如 OC 文和漫画。中文漫画倒也画得不少，但英文写的东西总是更贴近我内心的。（还有一点就是英文的话我爸爸妈妈不会偷看，因为看不懂。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二点就是阅读。我总是读英文书更多一些。像比较流行的《猫武士》、《哈利波特》这些书，我要是能读懂原版那肯定读原版好啊。中文的书，我有点印象比较流行的就是《查理九世》、杨红樱的《马小跳》系列和《笑猫日记》系列、还有沈石溪的动物小说了。记得有一次小学阅读课上，老师给我们发了沈石溪的一本书，坐在我前面的同学说他好早就想要这一本了。这些书的共同点都是我当时看提不起兴趣，就又回去看英文书了；现在回想起来，能记得的部分就是依托勾式。比如《查理九世》里我记得当时跟同学借了一本标题好像是“稻草人之乡”，反正就是这个小镇里有一个什么神奇物质，小孩喝了能变完美，所以很多人就把小孩蒙鼓里，搬到这里来，让他们变完美。到最后真相揭露时，主角（还是旁白啊）说他们都是护子。好吧。我现在想起来那就是，没有一个家长会以“永远活在这个小镇里”为代价换取小孩变完美好不好，这个唯一经济支柱就是这种神秘物质的地方哪有工作做啊？变完美了也没用好吧。杨红樱的东西没太大印象了，沈石溪那更是依托。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而且，很多儿童文学我都感觉有股淡淡的机翻味？这个在电视节目里更明显，尤其是很多台配动画。要不是他们的口音纯粹像机器，要么是机器就是按照他们的口音来做的。上了初中后，很多要求的名著阅读那是当然不会读的，纯看考试攻略。我看过的最后一本中文小说是高一的时候看的《活着》（没算上《偷书贼》因为是译本，我还想把英文原版补上呢）。后面基本上都是看的勒卡雷了。我原先觉得很多那种“正经”的汉语文学（如初中必读）都过于晦涩难懂，但想想，勒卡雷对于英文的难懂程度不也差不多吗？所以不是读不读得懂的问题，还是想不想读。我觉得很多小时候没认真读的书可以拿起来重新看看，但不知道要到猴年马月了。（杨恒均的《致命三部曲》也老早就想看了，毕竟好到能把作者送进去的书到底能多好？？但我很担心这个作者的写作水平，毕竟网文。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;呃，所以就是这俩主要原因，一是写得多二是读得多，导致我一直爱用英文写东西。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我也期待某一天我能用维语读东西、写东西。为什么要学维语呢？我自己实际上也不太清楚。很多人学语言的动机是觉得它很美，或啥的。我当初想学法语是因为喜欢《丁丁历险记》。但维语，我觉得它难听死了好吧。喜欢歌是一方面吧，但也只喜欢那一首歌。还有就是就感觉学维语的人真的不够多。全世界都在学法语等西方语言，不缺我这一个（岌岌可危的多邻国连胜……我的 619 真的不想断啊啊啊）。而维语，连一个土生土长的新疆汉族人都不一定会一些基础词汇。而且学了维语，乌兹别克语就唾手可及了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;附上那首歌的歌词（维语基础教程里附的阿布达拉·阿卜杜尔汗的版本）：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;rtl&quot; style=&quot;text-indent: 0 !important&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;شۇ چاغلار&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;بۇلبۇللار سايرىشامۇ،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;گۈلشەن بولمىسا.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قىز-يىگىتلەر ئىزدىشەمۇ،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;مەيلى بولمىسا.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ھېچبىر كىشى ناخشا ئېيتماس،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;دەردى بولمىسا.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;مۇھەببەت ئوتى يۈرەكنى،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;پارە قىلمىسا.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;بۇلبۇللار سايرىشار،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;گۈلشەنلەر ئارا.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;شوخ گۈللەر تەۋرىشەر،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;مەيىن شامالدا.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;سەن كەتتىڭ، مەن قالدىم،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;غەمكىن شۇ چاغلار.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;خوش دېگەن ئاۋازىڭ،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ھېلى يادىمدا.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每一小节都重复了两次。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;哈哈，不是说好了说中文吗，怎么又开始维语了。就是想找借口练练维语拼写和打字吧。可能有错，勿喷。&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese chemistry</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-14.html" />
    <updated>2025-09-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-14.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I&#39;ve only taken Chemistry for two years so inaccuracies may appear. I&#39;m only accepting corrections in factual errors. I don&#39;t care if you have a different opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to yap about how learning Chemistry in Chinese is just. A lot better than learning it in English. It makes a lot of things more intuitive and therefore the entire subject easier. And it&#39;s not just because Chinese is my native language — I have native-level proficiency in English too and I&#39;m not letting anyone tell me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Chemistry in ninth grade when the entire thing was taught in Chinese. When I went to high school, I took an Honors Chemistry course that was still mostly in Chinese but the teacher also made us know all the English to prepare for AP Chemistry. (I never took AP Chem. I did CCC and got silver. Fuck them.) And that was when the contrast became really clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I spoke fluent Latin, I suppose I would&#39;ve found English Chemistry easy too? But I don&#39;t speak Latin so I can&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the periodic table of elements. With Chinese, not only is every element one character and therefore one syllable, but also the characters are designed so you can know some things about the element just by looking at the character. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every element that has 钅 on the left is a metal (with the &amp;quot;exception&amp;quot; of 金 (gold), which is literally just 钅). All the others are non-metals (with the exception of 汞 (mercury), which I&#39;ll talk about below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every element that has 气 on the top is a gas at room temperature. Like 氢 (hydrogen), 氧 (oxygen), and every noble gas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every element with 石 on the left is a solid at room temperature. Like 硅 (Silicon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two elements are liquids at room temperature. The non-metal 溴 (bromine), and the metal 汞 (mercury). They both have 水 (water) in their characters (氵 is just water).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the &amp;quot;type indicator&amp;quot; part, the other part of the character indicates pronunciation, so it&#39;s easy to pronounce it immediately. For example, 硒, the non-metal that&#39;s solid at room temperature, is pronounced the same as 西 (xī) (without the 石), despite looking a lot like 晒 (shài) which made a lot of people pronounce it wrong, LMAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly the chemists are also the only people with that special privilege to make new characters in the modern day. Like actually get them onto the dictionary and all that, for every new element discovered. But in the meantime I wonder what&#39;s the point of making all these new elements when none of them are going to exist for more than a millisecond or something like that. But whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes the inorganic compounds. None of those stupidly confusing number prefixes (monoxide vs. dioxide… why not &lt;em&gt;bi&lt;/em&gt;oxide?) because the numbers are literally one, two, three, etc.. To name a compound, simply take its chemical formula and read it backwards. For example, carbon monoxide (&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;C&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;CO&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut bottom&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base textstyle uncramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07153em;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.02778em;&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) would be &amp;quot;one oxygen compounded with carbon&amp;quot; (一氧化碳), and carbon dioxide (&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;C&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;CO_2&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut bottom&quot; style=&quot;height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base textstyle uncramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07153em;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.02778em;&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:0.15em;margin-right:0.05em;margin-left:-0.02778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;reset-textstyle scriptstyle cramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;baseline-fix&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) would be &amp;quot;two oxygen compounded with carbon&amp;quot; (二氧化碳). There are, of course, exceptions&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-14.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, like hydrogen peroxide (&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;H&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;H_2O_2&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.68333em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut bottom&quot; style=&quot;height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base textstyle uncramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.08125em;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:0.15em;margin-right:0.05em;margin-left:-0.08125em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;reset-textstyle scriptstyle cramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;baseline-fix&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.02778em;&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:0.15em;margin-right:0.05em;margin-left:-0.02778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;reset-textstyle scriptstyle cramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathrm&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;baseline-fix&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0em;&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) being &amp;quot;too much oxygen compounded with hydrogen&amp;quot; (过氧化氢).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salts are named similarly. Sodium chloride (&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;C&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;l&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;NaCl&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.69444em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut bottom&quot; style=&quot;height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base textstyle uncramped&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.10903em;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07153em;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.01968em;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) is &amp;quot;chlorine compounded with sodium&amp;quot; (氯化钠).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one of these can have different valences, and extra characters are added to indicate whether they have a higher (高, literally &amp;quot;tall&amp;quot;) or lower (亚, typically meaning &amp;quot;sub&amp;quot;) oxidation state. Take iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride. While the IUPAC standard of roman numerals in parentheses can also be used, &amp;quot;chlorine compounded with iron&amp;quot; (氯化铁) and &amp;quot;chlorine compounded with sub-iron&amp;quot; (氯化亚铁) is more often used. The same goes for the anion part. Sodium sulfate is &amp;quot;sulfur acid sodium&amp;quot; (硫酸钠) (the &amp;quot;compounded with&amp;quot; is omitted when the &amp;quot;acid&amp;quot; is taking up a syllable) and sodium sulfite is &amp;quot;sub-sulfur acid sodium&amp;quot; (亚硫酸钠). No need to guess what -ate and -ite respectively mean when it&#39;s right there in the name. Acids and bases are also pretty much the same. Just take the formula and read it backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry features even more characters made up for the sole purpose of making chemistry easier. But it&#39;s also where the naming patterns are the closest to English, both conforming to IUPAC standards. But it still remained that each thing is one character (except 酰胺 (amide), which, between 胺 (amine), I can never tell the difference). In Chinese, numbering is pulled from the heaven stems, ten characters representing 1 to 10 (甲乙丙丁戊己庚辛壬癸), which is on the same level as the di- and tri- stuff since most people aren&#39;t familiar with the stuff over 4, despite 1 - 4 (甲乙丙丁) being familiar to most. But admittedly I&#39;ve forgotten most organic chemistry stuff. It seems that anything I learned in high school never stuck, but whatever I learned in middle school stays forever? (Except morality and law. I&#39;d go crazy if that thing stuck.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ten heaven stems are originally used in conjunction with the twelve earth branches to name years (each of the twelve earth branches is also associated with an animal from the zodiac). It takes ten by twelve makes sixty years to cycle through all the pairings, which is more than enough for people back then who rarely live above that. This year, 2025, is yǐ sì snake year (乙巳蛇年), and next year it would be bǐng wǔ horse year (丙午马年).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A way-too-late silkworm diary</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-16.html" />

    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-16.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In third grade we all had to keep a box of silkworms for Science class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;d buy it at those small stores they like to open near schools, selling drinks, snacks, ice cream, and of course silkworm boxes. Now that I think about it, how did the baby worms survive the shelf? Most of these stores are removed now because parents don&#39;t like their kids eating junk food. I wonder how they get their worms now. Over the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyways, it was this thin cardboard box that open on the top, not unlike the Marine Boy fish snacks (called &amp;quot;a lot of fish&amp;quot; in China). At first they were just tiny, ugly babies, shorter than the horizontal length of my current fingernail, looking like fried maggots, and really boring. But you keep feeding them mulberry leaves and they would grow. My uncle used to pick a sack of them from nearby trees for me while he was at work, which can last for a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They went through the leaves fairly quickly. Many of them died as babies, but eight survived into big worms. They turned big, fat, white, and greedy. Now that I describe it like that they were not unlike a cartoonish depiction of a capitalist. Some other kids&#39; silkworms were colorful, and while I don&#39;t really know the specifics, I know they were dyed with some pigments to appeal to kids more. All of mine were white though. They were about the thickness of my current pinky finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the part where we had the most fun too. We would take them out of the box and let them climb on our hands and desks. We would try getting them to shit on other people&#39;s desks. We&#39;d compare whose silkworm was the longest and the fattest. Teachers had yelled at us to keep the box in our drawers. No fewer than one silkworm met unnatural deaths due to us throwing them around. All eight of mine were fine though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they spawned cocoons. Two of mine were yellow for some reason, and I was so surprised, considering they were all white and I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; sure I got normal worms and not dyed ones. The cocoons made them too large for the box, so I moved them to a metal mooncake box, leaving the lid open for air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was when the rats came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They knew what was good for them alright. All these nights my worms were right out there in the open they never came. Now they became chrysalises and the rats knew they could eat that. Three disappeared on the first night. I moved the box to my room, but three more disappeared the second night. The two cocoons left was one white and one yellow. I really wanted to keep them safe and see what differences are in the moths from different colored cocoons. Wanting to shut the lid tight but fearing the chrysalises would suffocate, I kept a tiny slit open, but sure enough, the last two were gone in the morning. Can chrysalises even suffocate? It&#39;s too late to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to school the next day empty-handed. Some of my classmates already had moths. One started laying eggs on this kid&#39;s desk and the teacher ordered her to wipe it clean.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I used to like dogs but now I like cats more</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-19.html" />

    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-19.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was little I was a huge dog person. I drew puppies all the time and could name breeds at a glance. I dreamed of keeping a husky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you ask me now, I would say I&#39;m a cat person. Not that I &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; like dogs anymore; I just like cats more now. I could pretty clearly explain the reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, back then, I didn&#39;t like cats because I knew nothing about them. All my attention was on dogs that I never knew there were different breeds and colors to cats too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warrior Cats&lt;/em&gt; was the turning point for me. I didn&#39;t want to read it at first because it&#39;s about &lt;em&gt;cats&lt;/em&gt; and that&#39;s &lt;em&gt;boring come on&lt;/em&gt; but when I started reading it, I fell in love with it. I started to draw the characters, make cat OCs, and slowly started to like cats more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there&#39;s actually getting to know the real animals, rather than imaginary characters and pictures. Cat fur feels so soft and comfortable, and they clean themselves regularly. Dog fur, on the other hand… maybe I just haven&#39;t pet a Samoyed or something but all the dogs I&#39;ve pet have hard fur that felt like plastic wires. Golden retrievers, Labradors, poodles, and a couple of Tibetan Terriers once. They are not fun to touch, and they move around too often; too energetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also my mom got a cat a couple of years back and she is adorable. Her name is Sandstorm. I love her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently my aunt got a poodle and we would walk it for her when she didn&#39;t have time. Her name was May and she was really, really energetic, and I couldn&#39;t bring myself to love her like I do Sandstorm. Her fur is hard; that puffy part on her head didn&#39;t feel any good either since all I can really feel was the hard skull. And she was friendly, &lt;em&gt;way too&lt;/em&gt; friendly. She would jump onto our legs, which hurt, and lick my mom&#39;s mouth, which she hated. She would tug on her leash so hard I had to run to catch up. She was pretty fundamentally incompatible with my personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, this is why I like cats more now. I want a Maine Coon so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On things we don&#39;t understand</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-24.html" />
    <updated>2025-09-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-24.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking back to when my mom and I were in Xinjiang, and we saw a bulletin board about the different types of wild animals local to the area, written in both Chinese and Uyghurche. My mom was all like, &amp;quot;these letters all look the same to me!&amp;quot; Even after I repeatedly told her &amp;quot;they look the same because you can&#39;t read them. They will look vastly different if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; read it. Conversely, all Chinese characters would look the same to someone who can&#39;t read Chinese.&amp;quot; She then said, &amp;quot;well Chinese is really obvious, the characters are all different! But for this, all the letters are the same!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We repeated our words a couple times over to each other, an extremely unproductive conversation of &amp;quot;how could anyone understand this?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They can, you cannot! They can&#39;t understand Chinese either!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;But how could anyone understand this?&amp;quot; … She even brought it up again when we went back to Shenzhen and saw some Uyghur restaurants with the Arabic script Uyghurche written on the sign. By then, I had begun learning Uyghurche, and could read a little bit of the pronunciation — despite me literally reading the sign out to her (although I still didn&#39;t understand what the sign said either), she was &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; like, &amp;quot;how could anyone understand this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me as interesting how when we saw something we didn&#39;t understand, my mom&#39;s reaction was largely negative towards it, and had a very stubborn layer of assuming nobody else could understand it if she herself could not; and assuming other people can understand anything that she can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom was getting old, so I don&#39;t blame her for repeating things and not listening to me. But I can&#39;t help but think about this mentality. This goes deeper than a negative attitude towards things we don&#39;t understand, like I mentioned before; there&#39;s this inability to see things from other people&#39;s viewpoint. My mom, being able to read Chinese but not Uyghurche, cannot imagine a person being able to read Uyghurche but not Chinese. Uyghurche was gibberish to her, so she can&#39;t imagine anyone comprehending it; Chinese was very clear to her, so she can&#39;t imagine anyone seeing it as gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to think about whether I had done this too. It goes beyond just languages and cultures; it includes anything I cannot understand or appreciate, like abstract art, religion, philosophy, or just about anything that appears too &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; to me. Would my rejection of them make me un-accepting to new ideas? Conversely, for things I do like and understand, like just English for a quick example, might I appear too haughty to people who don&#39;t understand it as well as I do? This should be something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paper books are just better until they aren&#39;t</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-30.html" />
    <updated>2025-09-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-09-30.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Paper books are better. This sentiment is probably shared among a lot of people, but since it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; blog I&#39;m talking about my personal experiences with paper, e-books, and reading in general here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love reading. Mostly because I didn&#39;t have friends, but well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom made me read a lot of stuff. Before I could talk she was reciting the &lt;em&gt;Three Character Classic&lt;/em&gt; to me; they still have a video of that on an old external hard drive. We had all the &lt;em&gt;Berenstain Bears&lt;/em&gt; books (in Chinese) and my dad would read it aloud to me and my brother every night. Despite huge cultural differences, they were actually quite relatable to us because there&#39;s a big brother and a little sister. Whenever we went outside, she would point at literally anything with words written on it and read it aloud to me; to this day I still have the habit of reading literally any sign I come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could already read most kids&#39; stuff when other kids were still agonizing over learning pīnyīn. In fact, I learned pīnyīn &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I learned to read characters. I still remember that in second grade, we were still using the old, small version of the Chinese textbook, and we were reading this story about a little gecko who lost its tail. The teacher asked us if we noticed anything different about this story than all the previous content of the book. I was legit confused and didn&#39;t know what was different, but multiple kids immediately raised their hands saying that it was the first passage written without pīnyīn above the characters. Only then did I really notice that indeed, the pīnyīn was gone and the typography was a lot more tidy as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we went to the US where there was a library really close to us. I&#39;d spend hours just there, reading through &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Magic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A-Z Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Warrior Cats&lt;/em&gt;, and possibly a bunch of other books I forgot about. (Really sad that I didn&#39;t know about &lt;em&gt;Captain Underpants&lt;/em&gt; right then.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, reading is great. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last physical book I purchased was &lt;em&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/em&gt;, which cost me a great 300 yuan and I never opened it, LMAO. Before that I bought the &lt;em&gt;Wings of Fire&lt;/em&gt; series. The books were great, but not that worth buying, since they&#39;re pretty short and don&#39;t feature that many elements that would be better on an actual page, like pictures or unique formatting. Before then I also got the first like 7 books of &lt;em&gt;Spy School&lt;/em&gt;, which I gave away to one of my mom&#39;s colleague&#39;s son after finishing. Now that I think about it I should really see if I can get my mom to tell the kid to stop reading those books, but it was a while ago… Also I kept buying &lt;em&gt;Dog Man&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cat Kid&lt;/em&gt; comics because you&#39;re just supposed to read comics in paperback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in middle school my dad got me a Kindle. I started to read e-books then, because they are indeed way more convenient. But here&#39;s the shame of my entire life that I could never erase: I didn&#39;t know how to pirate back then. I bought most of these e-books. Some newer &lt;em&gt;Warrior Cats&lt;/em&gt;, random one-offs, and heavens forbid the entire &lt;em&gt;Captain Underpants&lt;/em&gt; series — I mean, those picture / comic books are way better off when read in paperback, not to mention the Flip-O-Ramas. I want to slap old-me in the face for this. And also it&#39;s Amazon so all my purchases were made in fucking USD with my dad&#39;s ancient credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read most John le Carré books, and all of the spy novels now that I think of it, with pirated EPUBs that I email to the kindle. Because there are simply so many of them. I would definitely go broke if I actually bought them. There is also no way I can fit all of them at home, especially since we started moving between the commie-block and Grandma&#39;s all the time — I could only read my physical book collection when we were in Grandma&#39;s, but I can read my e-books anywhere, as long as I have my kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t bring my kindle to the US because it&#39;s getting old with an annoyingly short battery life and it charges with that old asymmetric Android plug. Even before then, during the summer, I was reading more with my phone. Which made my reading progress significantly slower as I keep getting distracted and switching to other apps; and it&#39;s a lot harder on my eyes. I spent way too long on &lt;em&gt;The Little Drummer Girl&lt;/em&gt; and had been stalling on &lt;em&gt;A Perfect Spy&lt;/em&gt; for two months because of this. Not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why, today, I decided to check out my school&#39;s library to see if they had it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&#39;t been in a proper library since my last time in the US. I&#39;ve only went to my high school&#39;s library for the purpose of &lt;s&gt;studying&lt;/s&gt; wasting time on my computer; and in addition we didn&#39;t have many English books and they were all messily organized. Something interesting. The most-borrowed book there was &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt;, which tells you everything you need to know about this godforsaken high school. And also the second most-borrowed was &lt;em&gt;The Moon and Sixpence&lt;/em&gt; which was obviously required reading in class for the college-entrance track kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I got this huge-ass copy of &lt;em&gt;A Perfect Spy&lt;/em&gt; that was old as fuck and just the way I think books should be. Old, yellowed, fuzzy at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about paper books is just. They&#39;re paper books. There&#39;s no better feeling than the feeling of a solid book in your hands whose pages you can flip through; especially if the paper is old and yellow and gives off that book-smell. But I also like e-books in that I can pirate them forever, and I can carry an entire library inside my phone. But e-books are used out of necessity. If I can conveniently get a paper book, I&#39;d go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I feel like I often use too much of the phrases &amp;quot;in my opinion&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I think&amp;quot; here. Which is stupid, because this is &lt;em&gt;my blog&lt;/em&gt;. What do you think I write, if not my opinions? Literature reviews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should refrain from these phrases as much as possible in the future. This is my blog; I don&#39;t need to walk on eggshells, going &amp;quot;I think cats are cute, this is just my personal opinion of course, other people might have different opinions and they&#39;re totally valid too, it&#39;s just in my humble opinion that cats are cute.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should check if you use too much of this type of language too. Thanks for listening to my TED talk I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Site doc: characters popping up when hovered</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html" />
    <updated>2025-10-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Out of boredom I&#39;m going to write about how I did some of the stuff I did on my site. You can reference this and I hope this can help you, but remember that not everyone&#39;s use case is exactly the same, so always make sure you know what a code is doing before copying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to the index page of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll/&quot;&gt;TIR site&lt;/a&gt; you will find a grid of cards with characters drawn on them, that will pop up when you hover over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details open=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Contents&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html#the-grid-itself&quot;&gt;The grid itself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html#the-popups&quot;&gt;The popups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html#animation&quot;&gt;Animation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html#responsiveness&quot;&gt;Responsiveness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-grid-itself&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The grid itself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cssgridgarden.com/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grid Garden&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic resource for learning CSS grids. The grid part is fairly simple. Just a regular old grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.grid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grid&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;auto-fill&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;minmax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;250px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 1fr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;grid-auto-rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1fr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 2em&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 2em 0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;minmax(250px, 1fr)&lt;/code&gt; means that each individual column will be &lt;code&gt;1fr&lt;/code&gt; (one fraction) wide, which means every column will be the same width. But if they&#39;re smaller than 250px in width, they will reduce the number of columns until they&#39;re bigger than 250px again. This makes the two columns collapse into one on smaller screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;auto-fill&lt;/code&gt; bears no difference to its alternative, &lt;code&gt;auto-fit&lt;/code&gt; here, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; explains their differences well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grid-auto-rows&lt;/code&gt; makes sure each row is &lt;code&gt;1fr&lt;/code&gt; no matter how many rows there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the cards, &amp;quot;Characters&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;World,&amp;quot; are bigger than the rest. They simply have the &lt;code&gt;big&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.big&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;grid-row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; span 2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning they will span 2 rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grid, I made 10 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s that are the cards you see. Inside each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; there is a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element that contains the background image and text&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-popups&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The popups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put the character art as background images on the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s. Here are the pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are the same size as the cards on a 1920px screen. Sparky and Buttercup are bigger because their cards are bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base code for background placement looked like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; cover&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--font-size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; * 3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; no-repeat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;image-rendering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; pixelated&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;image-rendering: pixelated&lt;/code&gt; stops the browser from blurring pixel art. &lt;code&gt;background-position: center&lt;/code&gt; centers the background horizontally, and the &lt;code&gt;calc(var(--font-size) * 3)&lt;/code&gt; after it lowers it vertically by a certain amount. You see why I included the font size &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html#responsiveness&quot;&gt;in a later section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the big cards, I lowered them further by 10px for some reason. It took tweaking and trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.big .card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--font-size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; * 3 + 10px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hover, I simply set the vertical background position to 0 (&lt;code&gt;center 0&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the big cards, there was a problem. There was a little gap between the bottom of the character and the bottom border of the card, which I hate. So I&#39;m tweaking and trying again, ending up with &lt;code&gt;center calc(var(--font-size) / -4 + 20px)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;animation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Animation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good old &lt;code&gt;transition&lt;/code&gt;. In Chrome DevTools, there is a handy little bezier curve tool — just click the little symbol next to a &lt;code&gt;cubic-bezier(…)&lt;/code&gt; CSS function. Here&#39;s mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/popup%20bezier.png&quot; alt=&quot;popup bezier&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that my animation makes them go overboard a little before returning back to the target value. This is what made them bounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; all .3s &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cubic-bezier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 1.5&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;responsiveness&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Responsiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had used pixel values for my offsets, they wouldn&#39;t have been mobile-friendly. That&#39;s why I used my &lt;code&gt;--font-size&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of the variable is this: &lt;code&gt;clamp(16px, 0.75rem + 0.8vw, 24px)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s called &amp;quot;fluid typography,&amp;quot; meaning font size changing with screen size. It grows on bigger screens and shrinks on smaller ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;clamp&lt;/code&gt; function clamps the middle value (&lt;code&gt;0.75rem + 0.8vw&lt;/code&gt;) between a minimum (16px) and a maximum (24px); and with &lt;code&gt;vw&lt;/code&gt; (viewport width), the middle value changes with screen width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t write the damn thing myself; it looks horrifying. I used a nice tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://clamp.font-size.app/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using this variable in calculating the background offset, I get to make it responsive. I also calculate the heading sizes based on this variable so all the text shrinks and grows properly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why didn&#39;t I just use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? I don&#39;t know; I must&#39;ve had my reasons. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-07.html#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;换季感冒了。周二早上起来就喉咙疼，喝点热水好了些就没吃药。要在国内早就蓝芩抗病毒哐哐灌了，但这边没得买。周三不出意外地还是疼，外加头疼得要命，早早睡了觉感觉好多了。周四买了 DayQuil 和 NyQuil，18 刀结果每盒里只有八片，感觉有点坑人。一粒药不小，吞完两粒胸口会闷好一阵子。NyQuil 说好的犯困呢？反正我不困。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;周四晚上嗓子就开始哑了。本来就是那种很正常的哑，感觉清一清喉咙就好了，但是清了也没用。这真是我第一次这样，也不知道怎么办，话还是照样说，还乐呵呵地录了些“现在的年轻人呐，不讲武德”的录音，觉得声音像老年人，很好笑。然后周五起来就说不出话了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也不是说不出。说还是能说的，就是很费劲，不如不说。喉咙还是吞咽的时候疼，但说话时再费劲喉咙也不会有特别的感觉。就是出来的声音哑。要是周四没硬说这么多话还会这样吗？但我说话时是真的感觉不到一点难受，就是哑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;要是在国内早跑社康去了。可能第一天吃点消炎药，或者第二天做个雾化，就不会这样了。跑了校医一趟，测了测血压，温度计塞嘴里没发烧，称了称体重是涨回来了；做了个核酸，不是新冠。那好，结论就是你回去多喝水多休息，几天后就好了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那我现在能咋办，硬撑着呗。反正放假，朋友都回家了，我也没人说话。&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Site doc: Using Github to deploy a site made with 11ty to Neocities</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html" />
    <updated>2025-10-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Out of boredom I&#39;m going to write about how I did some of the stuff I did on my site. You can reference this and I hope this can help you, but remember that not everyone&#39;s use case is exactly the same, so always make sure you know what a code is doing before copying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not clicked open the &amp;quot;edit site&amp;quot; button on Neocities in ages; I only open it when I want to check how much space I&#39;m using. Whenever I make an edit to my site, I just push the commit to the main branch and Github handles the rest. Here&#39;s how I did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details open=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Contents&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html#git&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html#11ty&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html#deploy-to-neocities-with-github-actions&quot;&gt;Deploy to Neocities with Github Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html#deploy-to-both-neocities-and-github-pages&quot;&gt;Deploy to both Neocities and Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html#deploying-to-a-subdirectory&quot;&gt;Deploying to a subdirectory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-12.html#other-minor-stuff&quot;&gt;Other minor stuff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;git&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetraPixel had made wonderfully-explained tutorials on a lot of these things already, so I recommend checking out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/git-tutorial&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Git tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/npm-tutorial&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NPM tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/eleventy-tutorial&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;11ty tutorial&lt;/a&gt; before reading this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is one of the most popular &lt;em&gt;version control systems&lt;/em&gt; nowadays. That means it&#39;s a tool for keeping track of older versions of your codebase so that if you screw up, you can revert back to an old version. Branches are also helpful. You can create a branch for a new part of your site, or perhaps a redesign, and if you screw up you just go back to the main branch and delete the new branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have Github Desktop downloaded, which is a GUI that makes things easier. This is back when I was in China and pushing and pulling took ages and I didn&#39;t know how to configure proxies (still don&#39;t). My VPN proxies all desktop applications automatically so it made things way faster. Now I won&#39;t be needing it since VSCode has a GUI for Git too and it&#39;s not as slow as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;11ty&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11ty is a static site generator (SSG), meaning it takes a bunch of template files, fills in the templates, and outputs a bunch of HTML files for the browser to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static site generators are great for bigger sites. Suppose I want the same header and footer on every page. I can copy / paste stuff, but what if I want to update the header? I&#39;d have to update everything! And don&#39;t even bring up iframes in front of me. They&#39;re like loading one page for the price of two. They&#39;re only good for embedding &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; website in yours, like Youtube videos, guestbooks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also recently learned about JavaScript custom elements (components), which could be worth checking out if you don&#39;t mind a lot of client-side JS and don&#39;t want to go all SSG. But SSGs still offer greater flexibility than simply components. With 11ty, you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a layout so you have the same header and footer in every page, as well as all the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap a layout inside another layout for specific categories of pages that have their own shared sections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do pagination with data, which is how I made my character pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use data for literally anything, which is how I made many little games with the same character data file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically convert all your images to a certain size and format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use any templating language you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started out I made my site with the Liquid templating language, but it&#39;s quite stupid to work with and now my site&#39;s too big for me to switch to something else. If I were to make a new site, I would use &lt;a href=&quot;https://vento.js.org/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vento&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why yes, I am shilling for 11ty. If you don&#39;t use it yet, and you&#39;re thinking your site&#39;s starting to get disorganized… Scroll to the top and click on PetraPixel&#39;s tutorials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-neocities-with-github-actions&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Deploy to Neocities with Github Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the good part. Because sites generated by SSGs require a build step, that is, you need to run &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt; and check in the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; folder for the actual contents of the website, it means you can&#39;t directly dump your source code and expect the site to function. Github provides a great tool for you to run these build steps on their computers called Github Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything, you need to enable them in Github by going to Settings &amp;gt; Actions &amp;gt; General and checking &amp;quot;Allow all actions and reusable workflows.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things Github Actions are capable of which I don&#39;t know because I don&#39;t use them so I don&#39;t care. But each action is a &lt;code&gt;.yml&lt;/code&gt; file stored inside the &lt;code&gt;.github/workflows/&lt;/code&gt; folder of your repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each action has a trigger, the thing that makes the action run. If you want the build to run every time you update the site, the most common trigger would be on push — whenever local changes are uploaded to the remote. You&#39;ll also want it to trigger only when it&#39;s pushed to the main branch too, or your test changes on a test branch can get published and you don&#39;t want that. So at the start of &lt;code&gt;build.yml&lt;/code&gt;, there&#39;s usually this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build Eleventy
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I have a stupid birthday message system (which I may write about in the future) that requires one build per day to function, which this can do too! Just add another trigger that&#39;s a schedule, and schedule it to trigger once every midnight (UTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build Eleventy
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; main
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;0 0 * * *&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; property is a code for time. I don&#39;t understand it either; I grabbed it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://crontab.guru/every-day-at-midnight&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start deploying your site to Neocities, you need to access its API. Go to Settings &amp;gt; Manage site settings &amp;gt; API, and generate an API key. Don&#39;t show this to anyone else! People can edit your site with this; that&#39;s the whole point. Go to your Github repository, click Settings &amp;gt; Secrets and variables &amp;gt; Actions. These are the secrets that Github Actions can use. Click &amp;quot;New repository secret,&amp;quot; name it &amp;quot;NEOCITIES_API_KEY,&amp;quot; and set its value to the API key you generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest is copy work. Here&#39;s how your file might look, if you&#39;re deploying to Neocities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build Eleventy
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; main
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;0 0 * * *&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest

    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@v3

      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Use Node.js current

          npm ci

        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;api_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; secrets.NEOCITIES_API_KEY &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;cleanup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;dist_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; _site&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cleanup: true&lt;/code&gt; deletes the files that are on Neocities but not in the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; folder. Set this to true, or otherwise old files you&#39;ve deleted will still appear on your site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three steps here. The first step makes the computer use Node.js. The second builds your 11ty site. Make sure you do have a script called &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file! If not, simply add this in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// the &quot;scripts&quot; object should already exist. If not then just add it too.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;build&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;eleventy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the final step uploads everything in the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; folder to Neocities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s important to not include any file that&#39;s not in the list of approved file formats, or the action fails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-both-neocities-and-github-pages&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Deploy to both Neocities and Github Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my site mirrored in both these places. I just need another step in my action file to deploy it to Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Deploy
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; peaceiris/actions&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;gh&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;pages@v3.8.0
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;github_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;publish_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; _site
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;publish_branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; gh&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; secret comes automatically.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Github, go to Settings &amp;gt; Pages and enable Github Pages deploying from the branch &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;. You might need to let this action run (and fail) once first before being able to select that branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploying-to-a-subdirectory&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Deploying to a subdirectory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s a problem! Unless your repository is named &lt;code&gt;tofutush.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, Github Pages will deploy the contents of this site to a subdirectory, &lt;code&gt;tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, all of the absolute links in your site will break. You link &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; in hopes that it will take you to the home page &lt;code&gt;tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll&lt;/code&gt;, but it would take you to &lt;code&gt;tofutush.github.io&lt;/code&gt; instead. How do we solve this problem without resorting to using relative links everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11ty already provides a solution. When running &lt;code&gt;eleventy&lt;/code&gt;, you can pass in a &lt;code&gt;pathprefix&lt;/code&gt; variable that&#39;s exactly what the &lt;code&gt;The-Iron-Ragdoll&lt;/code&gt; in the URL is. So if I run &lt;code&gt;eleventy --pathprefix=The-Iron-Ragdoll&lt;/code&gt;, 11ty will host your site in &lt;code&gt;localhost:8080/The-Iron-Ragdoll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, we need to transform every absolute URL into &lt;code&gt;/The-Iron-Ragdoll/&lt;/code&gt; too. The plugin comes straight with 11ty so you don&#39;t need to install it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// .eleventy.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; EleventyHtmlBasePlugin &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;@11ty/eleventy&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;eleventyConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	eleventyConfig&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addPlugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;EleventyHtmlBasePlugin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Add the &lt;code&gt;addPlugin&lt;/code&gt; line into your config function if it exists (which is most likely). Don&#39;t create another function!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, you can make a new build script, one for Neocities and one for Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;build&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;eleventy --pathprefix=The-Iron-Ragdoll&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;buildneo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;eleventy --output=_neocities&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;buildneo&lt;/code&gt; script changes the output directory from &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;_neocities&lt;/code&gt; so I don&#39;t override things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my final action file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build Eleventy
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  push&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    branches&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; main
  schedule&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

          dist_dir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; _neocities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There is a line, &lt;code&gt;npm run copy&lt;/code&gt;, that copies my images from &lt;code&gt;_site/img&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;_neocities/img&lt;/code&gt;. You probably don&#39;t need it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we go. Don&#39;t we all love this automatic shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-minor-stuff&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Other minor stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;eleventyConfig&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setQuietMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets rid of all the lines telling you which file had been written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;eleventy &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--serve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--incremental&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--pathprefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;The-Iron-Ragdoll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my serve script. The &lt;code&gt;--incremental&lt;/code&gt; flag makes sure that when I change a file, only that file will be updated, instead of the entire site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;tir&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;../_includes&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;layouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;../_layouts&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;../_data&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;passthroughFileCopy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the return object of my 11ty config function. &lt;code&gt;input: &#39;tir&#39;&lt;/code&gt; puts all my input files in the &lt;code&gt;tir&lt;/code&gt; folder instead of at the root folder, so I can open that folder in Obsidian and it won&#39;t have too many extra folders and files I don&#39;t want to see while editing my site. If you did that though, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to set &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; to the parent directory, because 11ty will still be looking at them relative to &lt;code&gt;tir&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also separated the layouts and include files because there were too many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it, I think! I hope you find this helpful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese names are &lt;strong&gt;surname + given name&lt;/strong&gt;. Same goes for Korean, Mongolian, Tibetan, Vietnamese, Japanese, and possibly many others that I can&#39;t think off the top of my head. It&#39;s common for westerners to reverse it, but it&#39;s better to use the correct order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;surnames&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Surnames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a list of surnames in these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://baijiaxing.hao86.com/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The one with the nicest looking interface I&#39;ve found. It also ranks them by how common they are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gushiwen.cn/guwen/book_e5f673a3c14d.aspx&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;438 surnames limited to the original list, which only includes Han names&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buyiju.com/baijiaxing/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1381 surnames with the names of many different ethnicities too (but you need to click into them to actually see what ethnicity it&#39;s from)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Han names, one-character surnames are more common, but there are two-character surnames too. Using uncommon surnames can make your characters look cooler but using too many can make you look cringe. Women don&#39;t change their surnames after marrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;given-names&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Given names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han given names are usually 1 or 2 characters long, though more recently there has been more and more 4-character names too, either because it&#39;s a 2-character surname + 2-character given name, or 1-character surname + 3-character given name. In the PRC the legal name for a Han person cannot exceed 6 characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what I&#39;m going to talk about is the way everyone in my family comes up with names, and also just a common way in general. Of course this is not the only way to come up with names, but it is indeed common. It&#39;s determining what Wuxing element you lack, and making up for that in your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Wuxing elements are determined by birth time. Preferably down to the minute, but if you only have a rough time that&#39;s okay too; just choose the time block that&#39;s closest. Since you&#39;ll be naming OCs, you can also just arbitrarily set it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buyiju.com/sm/wx.php&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.buyiju.com/sm/wx.php&lt;/a&gt; and enter the birthday and time. Disregard name and gender; they&#39;re for other stuff. You only need birth date and time for Wuxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose some random dates and here are the results. This hypothetical person lacks gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/chinese%20names%20lack%20gold.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: this website is kind of stupid in that it remembers your info for the next session; you need to click &amp;quot;exit test&amp;quot; to enter another birthday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/img/chinese%20names%20exit.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After determining what element your character lacks, it&#39;s time to make up for it in their name. Either choose characters that literally contain the element in it as a radical (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=radicals&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dictionaries&lt;/a&gt; usually let you look characters up by radical), or choose characters with meanings that relate to the element (then you can think of an English word and translate that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some quick examples, take these common ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold / metal: 鑫，怡，瑞，祥，铭
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radicals: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrads=167&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;钅&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=61&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;忄&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=96&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;王&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=113&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;礻&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wood: 森，林，菁，荣，楷
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radicals: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=75&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;木&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=140&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;艹&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water: 淼，涵，沐，潇，泽
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radicals: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=85&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;氵&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire: 焱，煜，彤，卓，煊
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radicals: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=86&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;火&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earth: 垚，坤，悠，垣，懿
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radicals: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqrad=32&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;土&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to give them a 2-character given name, it&#39;s not necessary to have both characters contain the element. One is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not the only way to name characters! It&#39;s just how my family always named kids (aaaand my parents got my element wrong &amp;lt;/3). Another common way is to reference some classical texts, but that requires way to much literacy than I have. Or you can just do whatever random name you find nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also becoming common for parents to put both surnames in their kid&#39;s name, usually into a 4-character name. For example, Zhang Wangxinyu (wang xin yu). In this case, Zhang is still their official surname and Wang is just part of their given name, but it&#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;siblings&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Siblings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common for siblings to have some sort of pattern in their names. Usually they would (in 2-character given names) share one character — e.g. Wang Xinrui and Wang Jiarui, or Chen Ziqi and Chen Zixian. It&#39;s also becoming more common for one sibling (or twin) to have the father&#39;s surname while the other has the mother&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;taboos&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Taboos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how westerners love naming their kids after themselves? Some Louis the two hundredth bullshit. Well that&#39;s a taboo in China — you should never let a younger generation&#39;s name be similar to anyone in the older generations. This would only be relevant if you make a lot of characters in the same family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And well I can&#39;t think of any other taboos off the top of my head. Obviously it&#39;s bad to name your kids after bad stuff you know, but other than that IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ethnic-minorities&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Ethnic minorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ethnic minorities use Han-looking names with some patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a person with the surname 马 (mǎ) or 穆 (mù) has a good chance of being Hui — it actually came from Muhammed and Muslim respectively (well, uh, I think, I can&#39;t be 100% sure, but it&#39;s too big of a coincidence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Manchu person with the surname 付 (fù) is descended from Qing royalty (one of the eight flags. I forgot which. Not the yellow one though). I know because they told me. In fact many Manchu people had to change their names to Han-sounding ones to escape persecution in the years directly following the collapse of the Qing dynasty. It also means that if you try to make a Manchu character called Fu something I&#39;m going to call bullshit on you because I personally know them (well, some of them, but come on how many could there be). Manchu characters named 董 (dǒng) are thin ice because I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; know them personally but since they&#39;re from the yellow flag (IIRC) there could be way more of them scattered around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of Zhuang people have the surnames 韦 (wéi), 覃 (tán), 蒙, (méng), 农 (nóng), and 蓝 (lán).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of Koreans have the surnames 金 (jīn / Kim), 李 (lǐ / Lee), 朴 (pú / Park), (崔 (cuī / Choi), and 郑 (zhèng / Jeong). (I suppose this also holds true in Korea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in China, but about 40% of Vietnamese people have the surname 阮 (Nguyễn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-han-names&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Non-Han names?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I don&#39;t know that much about non-Han names but I do know naming conventions for Uyghurs. It&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;given name + father&#39;s given name&lt;/strong&gt;. So if you see someone named Aygül Memet, you immediately know her dad is Memet [Aygül&#39;s grandpa&#39;s name]. You should never refer to a Uyghur by only their last name (e.g. no calling her Ms. Memet), because that would be just literally calling their dad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An account of moving</title>
    <link href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-15.html" />
    <updated>2025-10-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-15.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have not moved that much but I hate it. I guess I just hate any sort of change in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember living in 6th floor, 4th floor, 8th floor, the commie-block, and Grandma&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently my parents still lived in my dad&#39;s dormitory when mom got pregnant. But they moved to 6th floor before I was born. Which brings into the question of when they bought 6th floor and how were they confident enough to move in so soon after furnishing it, considering how paranoid they were about newly-furnished spaces. They delayed my starting middle school for two weeks because the classroom I was assigned was newly-furnished. Unless 6th floor was pre-furnished when they bought it, which I doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently I had drawn all over the walls. When I was like, I don&#39;t know, 4 or something, they finally got all the walls repainted white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6th floor was outside the pass. According to the internet, the pass was canceled in 2010; but in practice it must&#39;ve gone on longer because I still remember the red and green taxis. It was when I got back from the US that I noticed the taxis all turned the same color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after starting elementary school we moved to 4th floor, a place close enough for me to walk to school myself. It was also probably cheaper because no one wanted to live on the 4th floor. I had my own room in 4th floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about 4th floor was the bauhinia flowers. We were just high up enough to be surrounded by them. In winter, I would wake up to a window full of pink. Sometimes they grow into the bars on the windows. Sometimes birds land on the branches. One time they cut down all the trees for no discernable reason but they quickly grew back up. There was one tree that remained a stump for a while, but someone put a rack around it with a sign saying &amp;quot;this tree is still alive — let it grow!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At noon I would also go to 8th floor, where my brother and his dad lived. They had no elevator. Neither did 4th floor but 4 stories was a lot easier to climb than 8. I would read my brother&#39;s collection of &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Tintin&lt;/em&gt; until the pages ripped, and eventually I bought another set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Grandma&#39;s place in the middle of nowhere one time for New Year. That was when COVID happened and 4th floor was in the middle of it, so we were stuck there. And then school started, which was awkward because 4 out of the 5 people living there needed to attend online classes — two as students and two as teachers, the one lucky folk who doesn&#39;t need to being grandma. But the apartment was quite new and we weren&#39;t planning on staying this long, so we didn&#39;t have Wi-Fi, and we couldn&#39;t afford doing so many online classes on data. We ended up borrowing the Wi-Fi of our neighbors directly upstairs. Now that I think about it, are they the ones with the kid who kept messing up &lt;em&gt;Ode to Joy&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we resumed offline classes and moved back to 4th floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school we moved again to the commie-block because of my parents&#39; work. This was the real upsetting one. We were leaving 4th floor for good, and I still don&#39;t think I&#39;m over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We moved everything to Grandma&#39;s, including my books, the pipa I&#39;d never touched since then, and Sandstorm. Sandstorm took a while to adjust. She found the nearest bed and crouched beneath it, refusing to come out for a couple days. Now she also liked poking her head dangerously out the window, not registering that we&#39;re now 5 times higher than we used to be and if she fell down again she&#39;s dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also started to move between the commie-block and Grandma&#39;s because nobody liked the commie-block. My parents would stay there in the weekdays while I was at school, and during weekends they would pick me up from school and drive to Grandma&#39;s. On Sunday they would drop me back off at school and go back to the commie-block. Sometimes they&#39;d have plans during the weekend so we would stay at the commie-block that week, and I&#39;d have to sleep on the couch, unless my dad was sick; then I&#39;d sleep on the bed with mom and he&#39;d be off to the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commie-block wasn&#39;t all bad. There&#39;s actually life there. We were also close to a shopping mall. There was no life at Grandma&#39;s. Everything felt dead and my room didn&#39;t feel like mine. There&#39;s some neighbor who practiced the piano every weekend. They were playing &lt;em&gt;Ode to Joy&lt;/em&gt; really badly for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post mainly to reminisce about 4th floor. I missed the feeling of home and the bauhinia flowers. Sandstorm seemed happier there too. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever find somewhere that I could feel like home again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Out of boredom I&#39;m going to write about how I did some of the stuff I did on my site. You can reference this and I hope this can help you, but remember that not everyone&#39;s use case is exactly the same, so always make sure you know what a code is doing before copying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;details open=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Contents&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-18.html#the-data&quot;&gt;The data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-18.html#gallery-pages&quot;&gt;Gallery pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-10-18.html#character-pages&quot;&gt;Character pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-data&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep all of my art in one huge-ass folder (all art from others being in another folder) and the data for all of them (including art from others) in a huge-ass &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; file. Here is what &lt;code&gt;gallery imgs.json&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each picture needs a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; property. If it doesn&#39;t have a &lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt; property, then it doesn&#39;t contain any of my characters and is therefore fanart. If it&#39;s drawn by someone else, it needs &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;authorUrl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, &lt;code&gt;gallery imgs.json&lt;/code&gt; is 4613 lines long. Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn&#39;t done yet, because I want to sort the entire file by date before using it in any capacity! 11ty allows you to make &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; data files, which is why I have another &lt;code&gt;gallery.js&lt;/code&gt; that returns the array but sorted by date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; gallery &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;./gallery imgs.json&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;json&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; gallery&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;date&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;localeCompare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;date&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I have to include &lt;code&gt;with {type: &#39;json&#39;}&lt;/code&gt; or 11ty throws a fit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in any content file, &lt;code&gt;gallery&lt;/code&gt; gives access to this sorted array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gallery-pages&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Gallery pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the data&#39;s ready, all there is left is to use it! For the gallery pages, I wrote filters to get all of my own pictures from a specific month of a specific year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;eleventyConfig&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;getOnlyMyArt&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; arr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;author&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
eleventyConfig&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;filterGalleryByDate&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;arr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; arr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;date&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you use it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token liquid language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt; myArtInJune2025 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; gallery &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function filter&quot;&gt;getOnlyMyArt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function filter&quot;&gt;filterGalleryByDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;2025-06&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Liquid&#39;s, and most template engines&#39; filtering chain works is basically the value before the filter is passed in as the filter&#39;s first argument — in this case &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt;. Any values after the filter, here it&#39;s &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;2025-06&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, will be passed in as the 2nd, 3rd, etc. arguments. So the thing above is equivalent to this in JS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; myArtInJune2025 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filterGalleryByDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getOnlyMyArt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gallery&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;2025-06&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The functions &lt;code&gt;getOnlyMyArt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filterGalleryByDate&lt;/code&gt; don&#39;t actually exist, since I registered them directly as filters, but we can pretend they do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the gallery pages, I made a page that has the a years data array in its frontmatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to edit this manually each year, but since it&#39;s only once a year I won&#39;t get tired doing this and attempt to automate it, LMAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then paginated this data, so 11ty would make a page out of each of these years. Inside each year, I cycled through the 12 months, which thankfully is quite easy to do in Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token liquid language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; month &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token range operator&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	// ...
&lt;span class=&quot;token liquid language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;endfor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside each month, I filtered for my art in that month, and displayed them on the page if there was a nonzero amount. With 11ty&#39;s &lt;code&gt;pagination.previous&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pagination.next&lt;/code&gt;, I can also link to the previous and next years on this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;character-pages&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Character pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place I need to show the art is in their pages! This is fairly simple as I only need to filter for all art where the &lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt; property contains the character&#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;eleventyConfig&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;filterGallery&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;arr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; arr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ch&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/code&gt; because they are all lowercase in the data, but the name I passed in is uppercase.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token liquid language-liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt; filteredGallery &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; gallery &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function filter&quot;&gt;filterGallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sparky&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as some characters&#39; galleries grew (looking at you Sparky), it would be bad to dump all of that on their main page. I could make a gallery subpage for that character if they have more than 10 images. How can I automate that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a neat thing I found. 11ty&#39;s collections feature, especially the part where it lets you make your own collections, doesn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to return an array of pages. You can have it return anything you like! Which is why I made it return a list of characters with more than 10 images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;eleventyConfig&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;charactersMoreThan10&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; characters&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		gallery&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
			img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ch &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
			img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;ch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code above filters the &lt;code&gt;characters&lt;/code&gt; array for characters with more than 10 images. You can see I never used the &lt;code&gt;collection&lt;/code&gt; variable, which 11ty was supposed to pass in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;img.ch &amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; part of the code simply ensures that when I did &lt;code&gt;img.ch.includes()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;img.ch&lt;/code&gt; wouldn&#39;t be undefined so it won&#39;t throw an error. If &lt;code&gt;img.ch&lt;/code&gt; doesn&#39;t exist, the statement gets cut off so anything after &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; doesn&#39;t get evaluated. But if &lt;code&gt;img.ch&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist, the interpreter moves on to the part after &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and returns the last part that&#39;s true (which is the second part in this case, since there are only two parts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a list of whatever characters have more than 10 images, so I can paginate that with a permalink set to be a subpage of that character!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;pagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; collections.charactersMoreThan10
  size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  alias&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ch
  addAllPagesToCollections&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;permalink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;characters/{{ ch.name | lowerCase }}/gallery/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the characters&#39; main pages, I also filtered for the first 10 images in their gallery, and linked to the subpage if they had more than 10 pieces. Wonderfully fully-automated big galleries. I love &#39;em.&lt;/p&gt;
