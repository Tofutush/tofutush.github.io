<h1>I'm learning to drive!</h1>
<p>Look I know I'm still owing the Counterfeit Monkey and Spider and Web posts, but I wanna talk about my first driving lesson right now.</p>
<p>The coach thought I had been practicing for a long time, and he was surprised when I told him this was my first time touching a steering wheel. I did mistake the gas for the brake and the brake for the gas each once though, and on another occasion forgot to brake when going down a slope, but overall I think I did well! I hit zero people, zero cars, and zero walls.</p>
<p>My main task is just to learn how to drive, instead of passing the test, because even if I got a license in China I'd still have to take another test in the US. But if I got a license in the US I'd be able to change it into a Chinese license. And the test in the US is insanely easy. My mom got a license there, and changed it when we got back in China. She could <em>not</em> drive I tell you.</p>
<p>Speaking of my mom, I also had to convince her yet again that there were peas in the US. This was not the first time we had this conversation. She was getting old.</p>
