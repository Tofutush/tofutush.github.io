<p>Hi. Tofutush here. Or Sirocco, whichever name you know me by.</p>
<p>IDK why I started a blog. I'm not a writer. But I just figured I wanted to do something about this site.</p>
<p>Yeesh I ran out of things to say pretty quickly. How about I tell you about my name, Tofutush. It's a silly name from Captain Underpants. Wow how old am I.</p>
<p>I like comics and my OCs. Look at them <a href="https://tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll">here</a>.</p>
<p>I gotta put a link to every site I'm on. Not a lot, mind you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://toyhou.se/Tofutush">Toyhouse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://artfight.net/~Tofutush">Artfight</a></li>
<li>Discord (tofutush)</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to go on Cohost. But then it shut down. This site's color scheme is taken from there.</p>
