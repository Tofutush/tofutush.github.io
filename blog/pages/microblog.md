Y'know, despite how much it influenced me, I don't think I ever read the *Warriors* series seriously. I've barely read beyond arc 2, which is when they moved to the lake, and the majority of the main plot happened there. I did read plenty of super editions and stuff that take place in the forest. I am still significantly more used to the forest than the lake. Like the forest just feels like "*the* setting" more than the lake to me.

Below is just me writing bullshit to look cool. Have I mentioned how pretty Arabic script is? Also I might wanna learn Old Uyghur Script just for the sake of it.

Also, I made some accommodations for right-to-left text. Basically added a Markdown-it plugin to forcibly add `dir="auto"` to every paragraph. And did the line-break lyrics thing! It's kind of hacky, basically I removed the text-indent on paragraphs that have a line-break in them (just assuming these are all lyrics).

If I ever get good enough to write an entire blog post, that's a future concern.

Added a bunch of useless new features to the microblog LOL. Now you can include and exclude multiple tags, as well as jump to the last post you read — though the latter requires JS. It does not care if you actually read the posts; it just stores the number of posts there were last time you visited and take you there should there be newer posts. So if you refresh the page, the value gets overridden.

Hey, I have an idea. If you make a game with those "atmospheric" background music you're legally obliged to include an option to switch to a happier track.

With all seriousness though, this game doesn't even have settings to adjust volume, let alone disable background music while still allowing sound effects.

Y'know, I've always been obsessed with *logical* actions characters take, and focusing on that too much makes me disregard the logical action *characters* take — what's in-character for them to do? Humans don't always take the most logical course of action. In fact, they *rarely* do. I think, in recognizing this, I can hopefully write characters with more personalities; and also make things easier for myself.

For example (this is from *Tadlet Kingdom Adventures* which has been privated for the time being) after Snowy assassinated Cloud and the Hamster police tore off a piece of her cloak, won't she ditch the cloak as soon as possible so she won't get recognized for the tear? But if that's the case, how the gang finds out that Snowy is the assassin would be a lot more convoluted (because I wrote that part not realizing the most logical action is to ditch the cloak). Also, keeping the cloak on signifies that Snowy is a dumbass, too arrogant to think the stupid hamsters would find her, and too confident in the Dog Tadlet Crown would have her back. Or maybe I'm just making excuses, who knows.

I have all the Blue Prince room thumbnails that I ripped, and the Polytopia assets that the devs had so generously shared on the internet. I used to have them on my old computer too, and now I haven't unzipped this new copy yet LOL. Now that I'm more self-aware about it, what can I collect next?

But on a more positive note, Candlelight Back Home inspiration! So this one is a little interesting. It's based off of a bit of non-TIR-related paracosming I've been doing for a while (the entire plotline is, from its inception). And I've incorporated it into Candlelight's story. Now, I won't ever share this non-TIR-related paracosm with anyone else. But I'm actually sharing its content with you since I literally adapted its plotline here.

To be honest, I'm not really happy that I'm paracosming more about this insane real-life AU than TIR lately. And I get all the stuff I used to get with TIR too, replaying nearly-identical scenes in my head over and over. And I don't like it. Because it's based off of real-life and really, really cringe. But I know I cannot stop the paracosm train, so I just adapt that stuff into TIR.

The Blue Prince House Builder is coming along well! Sometimes, I wonder if anyone is actually going to like these sorts of silly projects. But who cares, if I enjoy the process of making it, and learned from it? But that always brings me to the more difficult question — did I truly learn anything from it? Svelte is still a mess to me, and I'm pretty sure it's horrible practice to pass a function down from `App` into `Directory` and finally into `RoomDir` where it's called. But well, I'm going to invoke sunk cost fallacy and say, I've come so far.

Cool new idea: Harmony, after getting the mission to collect incriminating evidence on her parents, thought that she would find none, because of course her parents aren't criminals!

How does it justify her eagerness to join the MSS alongside Sugarcane later though?

Decided to start a microblog! Will post random stuff in here that are too short for posts. Usually I spit them into my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XzdA5vKkb2), but maybe if I spit too much the Social Media Overlords will come after my ass, who knows. It would also be nice to keep an archive of ideas, so it's easier to reference them later!

I foresee my future workflow being still spitting into Discord, but updating this here afterwards if I think it's worth saving.
