		<h1>Sparky and I</h1>
<p class="date">Posted: 2025-10-26
<p>It struck me how different Sparky is from myself. You know, usually people's main characters, let alone parames, would be a lot similar to themselves. But Sparky is different from me in every aspect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sparky is strong. I don't get out of bed unless I have to.</li>
<li>Sparky grew up in a rich family but isn't spoiled at all; compare that to Willow. I grew up below-average, yet came out quite spoiled.</li>
<li>Sparky is determined, self-assured, and confident. She would not let anyone cast doubt on herself.</li>
<li>Sparky is outgoing.</li>
<li>Sparky is loud and obnoxious.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know what caused her to be this way. It's not like she's someone I aspire to be (rich family apart) — she's quite an annoying bitch to be honest.</p>
<p>In fact, I don't even think Qibli, my literal self-insert, was that similar to myself. I wouldn't know what character is similar to myself — I think it's because I don't even know that much about myself. I've never &quot;related&quot; to a fictional character before; I don't know how other people find them &quot;relatable.&quot; I've only thought they were cute and therefore loved them, or thought they were badass and therefore admired them.</p>
<p>I used to think I'm aro-ace due to me not understanding why shipping is so fun, but now that I think about it more, I feel like I just have an inability to form meaningful relationships<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, whether it's real or fictional people. Like, I don't get personalities. I can't see when someone (real or fictional) is &quot;out-of-character.&quot; Twilight Sparkle doing the same jumpy thing as Pinkie Pie wouldn't have struck me as off. Back when I was doing Chinese reading comprehension for the high school entrance exam where they ask you about a character's characterization and stuff, I simply attributed it to me having awful reading comprehension. But now I wonder if there's really something deeply wrong with me.</p>
<p>But anyways it's lunch time.</p>
