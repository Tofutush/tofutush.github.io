<h1>Webmaster Questionnaire</h1>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://zhongvie.bearblog.dev/2025-11-22/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Asuraid</a>!</p>
<ol>
<li>Please introduce yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tofutush.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How long have you been making websites?</li>
</ol>
<p>I… can't remember. For my main TIR site specifically, it's a little more than one year.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>And what got you into the hobby?</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay this is going to sound really long-winded like everything about me, but hear me out. So I liked Scratch as a kid, alright. And then for some reason I found out about BYOB, which is like another Scratch that let you <strong>b</strong>uild <strong>y</strong>our <strong>o</strong>wn <strong>b</strong>locks. And then, I was trying to find this BYOB thing again when I found out that it's changed to SNAP! BYOB, and it's written in JavaScript and open-sourced on Github. So I downloaded the code (without even knowing what Git was; I just downloaded the ZIP file) and played around with it. It's mostly JS (I lied it's <em>all</em> JS), so I learned JS, and somehow found Eloquent JavaScript which is a really good book it's online for free. I read the 3rd edition but it has a 4th edition now. I once even emailed the author once asking a really stupid question, and they emailed back answering it, and I still cringe at that. And then if you learned JS, it's only natural that you start making websites. I… I just realized I didn't really answer the question. Sorry.</p>
<p>Oh and there's <a href="https://mspfa.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">MSPFA</a> which, like, allows a lot of HTML stuff and I guess the TIR site started when I tried making a mirror of my comic.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What kind of website are you most interested in?</li>
</ol>
<p>Personal OC / Worldbuilding sites!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</li>
</ol>
<p>Nah I do the webmaster version of &quot;no beta we die like men.&quot;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Please link to your biggest inspirations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh my… here's this question that's always like &quot;I'd have a lot of stuff to say but not off the top of my head.&quot; <a href="https://numbersstory.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">Numbers Story</a> definitely is among the top. And <a href="https://bntarwarn.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">BNT's site</a>. There are many more sites that I love but I discovered them a lot later so they don't really count as inspiration.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>What's your favourite part about making websites?</li>
</ol>
<p>Making everything automated LOL, I love it when I just update one thing and multiple things on different parts of the website update accordingly. Like I add an entry to <code>gallery imgs.json</code> and the picture appears in the gallery and character galleries, etc.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>And the thing you struggle with the most?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think… layouts? Because, well, if you look at all three of my sites, they're all just vertical stuff going downwards LOL. I think the biggest problem was that I just have to make my font gigantic, and that makes columns really hard to do, because there isn't enough space left when the font's that big. And I just suck at design in general. Really scary considering designing is like a part of my major right now LOL I'm so cooked.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</li>
</ol>
<p>Mostly the same. Some have sub-layouts. Like world pages with their categories display and stuff. But the main layout is the same.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>How confident are you with CSS?</li>
</ol>
<p>Very.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Do you know how to correctly use <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>?</li>
</ol>
<p>Whelp, never heard of it. (Actually I heard it when reading Aid's response to this questionnaire but that doesn't count.)</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>What is your favourite HTML element?</li>
</ol>
<p><code>&lt;legend&gt;</code>. Girl's a legend.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</li>
</ol>
<p><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Do you know JavaScript?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>How about PHP?</li>
</ol>
<p>A little.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</li>
</ol>
<p>For TIR, most things are gray to emphasize the characters' soul colors. This website's color scheme is taken from Cohost.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Are you more focused on content or design?</li>
</ol>
<p>Content, probably.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</li>
</ol>
<p>No. I'd like to but I just can't commit. The domain I can purchase right now (<code>tofutush.cn</code>) wouldn't be useful in any professional capacity; what I'd like most is one whose apex domain I can use professionally someday in the future, and I can shove my TIR stuff into subdomains. Plus, I'm not sure whether the cheapest TLD for me (<code>.cn</code>) would be &quot;professional&quot; looking anywhere outside China — or inside China for that matter. Maybe when I'm actually there and less stingy I would buy something.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>What do you think of nostalgia-focused or &quot;retro&quot; websites?</li>
</ol>
<p>Eh, I'm not fond of them. They don't bring me any nostalgia because I'm young and had been on the internet for even less time.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be. I don't check but it should be.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</li>
</ol>
<p>I love buttons! Banners not so much, but I love some neat and tidy 88x31 buttons.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>What do you think of button walls in particular?</li>
</ol>
<p>When they get <em>too</em> big without <em>some</em> sort of categorizing I feel like they lose their point, but I do own a small button wall.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</li>
</ol>
<p>Very specific answer — I'd use Vento instead of Liquid, and it's going to be <em>pretty</em> different in terms of templating but not a whole ton of change in site structure and appearance.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Are you envious of other people's websites?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well yes, sometimes. Especially when they're very full of content (glances at Numbers Story…)</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>What text editor do you use?</li>
</ol>
<p>VS Code.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Why do you use that one?</li>
</ol>
<p>Atom died and everyone told me to switch to that. There was an Atom plugin that I loved though, it's called Pentagons or something and it literally just puts a bunch of floating pentagons in the background. For a while after the switch, I missed the pentagons so much I couldn't focus on any coding and tried using the dead Atom for a bit before it really became unusable.</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</li>
</ol>
<p>On the server.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't care. I still prefer Neocities for the social aspect, and I don't need to fetch anything really.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</li>
</ol>
<p>Neocities tells you that exactly, it's 112.74 MB.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Do you keep local backups of your files?</li>
</ol>
<p>Just one copy, which is the cloned Github repo, which doesn't really count as a &quot;backup&quot; LOL.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</li>
</ol>
<p>It depends on how the webmaster executed it. But I tend to the more simpler side.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</li>
</ol>
<p>Grayscale, because I suck at colors. Other than that, Cohost color scheme. If you really force me to make my own color scheme, I'd go for blues, because I like blue.</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</li>
</ol>
<p>No. Sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, if they consider me friends?</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Do people in your real life know about your website?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Do you update your website very often? How often is &quot;very often&quot;?</li>
</ol>
<p>It auto-updates every day LOL. But other than that, I do update it quite often, especially when I'm procrastinating on real-life tasks.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>No. Lazy; and aforementioned lack of design skills.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</li>
</ol>
<p>Hobby, I suppose. It's revolved around TIR I mean. This blog is me-focused; it's literally a blog.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Do you do web design professionally?</li>
</ol>
<p>No.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<ol start="41">
<li>Do you communicate with people by email very much?</li>
</ol>
<p>There's school; and I usually contact the OC Webring people with email if that's what they left as their contact method.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ol start="44">
<li>Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes. Random stuff. Every MLP song. Many Homestuck songs. And — <em>sigh</em> — Hazbin Hotel songs. And random stuff I come across that I download and horde in my offline music library 3GB large.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</li>
</ol>
<p>Three. TIR, blog, OC webring. Sometimes I talk about TIR meta on this blog.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li>On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</li>
</ol>
<p>Blog covers anything I want to write about.</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Refer to <a href="/posts/2025-10-26">this post</a> — I don't know what my real self looks like. But I don't try to construct a persona, so I suppose this is my real self.</p>
<ol start="48">
<li>Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, it depends on whether they think I'm their friend LOL. It's not like I actively reach out and talk to them. Well.</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, most of the time.</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>What are practices that you think people should avoid?</li>
</ol>
<p>Iframes containing content of the same site (they're for embedding other sites' contents!). Too much client JS. Fancy fonts (but now that I override fonts it doesn't matter that much — except those iframes, ugh!) Using <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code> on literally everything.</p>
<ol start="51">
<li>What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/posts/2025-10-07#responsiveness">Fluid typography</a>.</p>
<ol start="52">
<li>Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, I do use a lot of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s LOL.</p>
<ol start="53">
<li>Do you consider different browsers?</li>
</ol>
<p>Not really, eh.</p>
<ol start="54">
<li>Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Chrome. Don't use it. Use Firefox. Thank you.</p>
<ol start="55">
<li>And what OS are you on?</li>
</ol>
<p>Windows 11, ugh.</p>
<ol start="56">
<li>Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</li>
</ol>
<p>I just happen to. It sucks. Use Linux. Thank you.</p>
<ol start="57">
<li>Are your websites mobile-friendly?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<ol start="58">
<li>What are your thoughts on autoplay?</li>
</ol>
<p>I hate them hate them hate them</p>
<ol start="59">
<li>What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</li>
</ol>
<p>I like them! Though I think I'm now in enough of them that I don't actively join more. I also have <a href="https://oc-webring.neocities.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">one</a> myself!</p>
<ol start="60">
<li>Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</li>
</ol>
<p>No.</p>
<ol start="61">
<li>Are your websites &quot;cliche&quot;, in your opinion?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know? It certainly looks kinda generic and &quot;corporate,&quot; I guess. Refer to my non-existent design skills LOL.</p>
<ol start="62">
<li>What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</li>
</ol>
<p>So full of content. It answers every question you raise. It gets you immersed in my world, turns into a fan of TIR and a fan of me, and eventually you will worship me as your god —</p>
<ol start="63">
<li>Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</li>
</ol>
<p>I draw!</p>
<ol start="64">
<li>What are your favourite resource sites?</li>
</ol>
<p>Eh, I don't really know any.</p>
<ol start="65">
<li>Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</li>
</ol>
<p>Itching to change layout, add new stuff, etc; only to give up because of this huge-ass font I'm adamant on not changing and my terrible design skills and my high standards.</p>
<ol start="66">
<li>What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't be afraid to use templates, don't be afraid to copy code, and utilize the DevTools!</p>
<ol start="67">
<li>Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, the hard-coded styles are still CSS! But yeah most of them are in CSS files. If there's a small thing I need a style for and I don't want to create a class just for that, I code it into the style property.</p>
<ol start="68">
<li>What do you think of frameset layouts?</li>
</ol>
<p>Archaic.</p>
<ol start="69">
<li>How about table-based layouts?</li>
</ol>
<p>Archaic.</p>
<ol start="70">
<li>Do you subscribe to the ideas of &quot;one-column&quot;, &quot;two-column&quot; and &quot;three-column&quot; layouts? Do you use any of these?</li>
</ol>
<p>Mine is one-column. I don't know how they are &quot;ideas&quot; you &quot;subscribe&quot; to… They're just layouts?</p>
<ol start="71">
<li>Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</li>
</ol>
<p>CSS.</p>
<ol start="72">
<li>Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nah.</p>
<ol start="73">
<li>Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</li>
</ol>
<p>Nope.</p>
<ol start="74">
<li>Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd say somewhere between middle and advanced.</p>
<ol start="75">
<li>Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ol start="76">
<li>How did YOU learn how to make websites?</li>
</ol>
<p>I forgot LOL. Refer to question 3.</p>
<ol start="77">
<li>Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe that had happened. I don't know.</p>
<ol start="78">
<li>Thoughts on floating elements?</li>
</ol>
<p>Only for images.</p>
<ol start="79">
<li>When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</li>
</ol>
<p>Either <code>em</code> or <code>%</code>, depending on situation.</p>
<ol start="80">
<li>Do you have a favourite font?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.lexend.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Lexend</a> <a href="https://www.lexend.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Lexend</a> <a href="https://www.lexend.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Lexend</a> <a href="https://www.lexend.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Lexend</a> <a href="https://www.lexend.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Lexend</a> <a href="https://www.lexend.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Lexend</a> —</p>
<ol start="81">
<li>Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would probably not.</p>
<ol start="82">
<li>Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</li>
</ol>
<p>At first yes; but now I'm following a lot of people on Neocities I find my local feed enough to satiate me.</p>
<ol start="83">
<li>Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't really bookmark sites. I follow them on Neocities, or add their button.</p>
<ol start="84">
<li>What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</li>
</ol>
<p>My OCs and world and their stories!</p>
<ol start="85">
<li>Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</li>
</ol>
<p>Kind of? I don't collect.</p>
<ol start="86">
<li>How often and for how long are you online?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm chronically online.</p>
<ol start="87">
<li>When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</li>
</ol>
<p>Myself, and whoever's out there I guess.</p>
<ol start="88">
<li>Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</li>
</ol>
<p>It's HTML's <a href="https://tofutush.neocities.org/characters/willow/" class="external-link" target="_blank">half-sister</a> born with a <a href="https://tofutush.neocities.org/characters/peacock/" class="external-link" target="_blank">stepfather</a> (XML) that <a href="https://tofutush.neocities.org/characters/sparky/" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTML</a> hates, and said half-sister manages to throw more tantrums than HTML ever could in her life and she's an annoying, spoiled wreck.</p>
<ol start="89">
<li>Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, if AP CSA counts then Java LOL. Tried making some games so there's C# and GDScript.</p>
<ol start="90">
<li>Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://11ty.dev" class="external-link" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> <a href="https://11ty.dev" class="external-link" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> <a href="https://11ty.dev" class="external-link" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> <a href="https://11ty.dev" class="external-link" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> <a href="https://11ty.dev" class="external-link" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> <a href="https://11ty.dev" class="external-link" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> —</p>
<ol start="91">
<li>Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>No. I'd say I don't care but I do a little LOL; but Neocities's view count was good enough.</p>
<ol start="92">
<li>Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</li>
</ol>
<p>32-bit Cafe, lurking.</p>
<ol start="93">
<li>Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</li>
</ol>
<p>For Markdown files I use Obsidian. For the character pages, they're generated by an obnoxious <code>.json</code> data file that I edit using a program I wrote myself and it's kinda neat and kinda hell.</p>
<ol start="94">
<li>Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</li>
</ol>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<ol start="95">
<li>Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeah, the <a href="/posts/2025-11-17">Hillslope comics</a>.</p>
<ol start="96">
<li>Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would definitely leave an archive.</p>
<ol start="97">
<li>Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I overshare LOL.</p>
<ol start="98">
<li>Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't have an online bestie, I don't think. (Subtext: nominations open.)</p>
<ol start="99">
<li>And do you optimise the images on your website?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I turn most of them into <code>.webp</code>s to torture y'all. The refsheets are available in <code>.png</code> though. And you can easily find all <code>.png</code>s on the Github repo.</p>
<ol start="100">
<li>We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ….other than exhausted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, my fingers feel numb.</p>
