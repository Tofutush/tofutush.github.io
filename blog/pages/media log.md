I will log the media I enjoyed here.

- Things from the past will be added gradually.
- Fanworks will be listed beneath the work itself.
- Longer entries will have their own blog post linked.
- No rating because I like them all; I won't log the things I hate (maybe for another post? LMAO I don't want to be more petty than I already am.)

## Books

### *Captain Underpants* series

- Date: Somewhere during early COVID.

Look pa, I actually bought these books! LOL that was before I knew to pirate stuff. It was e-books on Kindle too; I feel sorry for my ~~dad's~~ money.

Still, great books. Childish, but in a very intentional way that felt like the author is writing for his younger self.

Similarly, I've also enjoyed *Dog Man* and *Cat Kid Comic Club*. When I feel like it I'd probably expand those into their own sections.

### John le Carré

- Date: I forgot when from but still reading.

GOAT, need I say more? You can read more about espionage books in this previous [post](/posts/see-reading-john-le-carr-paid-off/).

## Comics

### Homestuck

- Date: From middle school to high school somewhere

Please don't be like me.

#### The Crow Strider AU

- Link: [MSPFA](https://mspfa.com/?s=44153&p=1)
- Date: Can't remember

Probably the only MSPFA comic I actually finished?

#### Herding Cats

- Link: [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/349720/chapters/568917)
- Date: Can't remember

Ship them all. All the beta trolls. SHIP. THEM. ALL.

## Movies

I see people putting year next to movie titles, and while IDK why, I did it too. Textbook definition of bandwagon.

### Dying to Survive (2018)

- Date: Rewatched it 2025-08-21

Really good movie about someone smuggling a life-saving medicine which is too expensive to buy legally.

## Games

### Type Help

- Link: [itch.io](https://william-rous.itch.io/type-help)
- Date: 2025-08-08

Classic "we're trapped in a mansion because there's a storm outside and why are there fewer and fewer living people" mystery. Though it contains supernatural elements, the point of the game is to figure out how the supernatural elements work.

### Henry Stickmin

- Link: [Steam (collection)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1089980/The_Henry_Stickmin_Collection/)
- Date: A long, long time ago

See: [Game: Henry Stickmin](/posts/2025-08-13/).

### Framed Collection

- Link: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322450/FRAMED_Collection/)
- Date: 2025-08-13

Another great permutations game. (I played another one before but can't remember its name for the time being.) You are to rearrange comic panels to help the main character escape. Features great visual storytelling too. This collection contains both the first and second game.

### UNREAL LIFE

- Link: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1335560/UNREAL_LIFE/)
- Date: Somewhere summer 2025

Why do I always run into games with teacher-student relationships in it?

But regardless, this is a really good game. You have to play it to feel it. It's kind of about imagination as an escape from reality. Also, you don't really *have* to see it as a teacher-student relationship so it's still pretty bearable.

### 三相奇谈 (Threefold Recital)

- Link: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3084280/Threefold_Recital/)

Amazing game. You can hear the pennies jingling in the dev team's impoverished pockets but you can also feel them pouring their hearts out in this.

For the poor part, the game definitely doesn't *look* like some amazing production; they've even used a shitton of free assets as evident in the credits section. But it legit has some amazing plot. (It's also the highest-rated Chinese Steam game in 2024 at 98% positive.)

To not spoiler things: it's about three furries, a Daoist fox, a Buddhist wolf, and an artist snake. There are three chapters dedicated to each of them as they solve some sort of mystery. In the last two chapters, the three come together and solve a bigger mystery.

Cute furries, beloved main characters as well as side characters, and stunning plot. Seriously, go play it. Hope no wolves barge in on you in the toilet.
