Hi. Tofutush here.

IDK why I started a blog. I'm not a writer. But I just figured I wanted to do something about this site.

Yeesh I ran out of things to say pretty quickly. How about I tell you about my name, Tofutush. It's a silly name from Captain Underpants. Wow how old am I.

I like comics and my OCs. Look at them [here](https://tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll).

I gotta put a link to every site I'm on. Not a lot, mind you.

- [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/Tofutush)
- [Artfight](https://artfight.net/~Tofutush)
- Discord (tofutush)

I used to go on Cohost. But then it shut down. This site's color scheme is taken from there.
