title: One Week of College

It's been a week. Well, I fucking hate college.

Technically it wasn't even a week. It's 4 days since we had Monday off. But it felt like an eternity. Most of my classes are just full of reading assignments and discussions and the likes. Makes me question my sanity. I *need* to take some math next semester.

Also, I have two online classes. Why did I fly all the way here just to attend *online* courses?? One of them has an in-person period each week, but the other is purely online. But! The purely online one locks future modules and only releases one each week, so you can't rush through all of them at the start either. Why the fuck.

I've played *Return of the Obra Dinn*. I've known it for a while, but the art style and the 3D put me off a lot. Well, I tried it, and I can't say I liked it. For all my love of mystery puzzle games, I can't play them at all, and have to consult a walkthrough with every little thing. But I also don't like the supernatural elements in there. I'm fine with supernatural *investigating*, like going into memory of the last moments of a corpse, but when the *answer* to the mysteries contains supernatural elements, I can't say I like it. I'd much prefer everything to be grounded in reality. *Obra Dinn* was like this; so was *Type Help*. But at least Type Help was easier. So yeah, Obra Dinn isn't going on the media list.

I'll spare you the freaking out about being alone, mostly because I can't really articulate my thoughts right now, but know that I *am* indeed freaking out about being alone and uncertain of the future. I have no idea what I'm going to do and more importantly if I can do it, and I don't think I'll ever have an idea.
