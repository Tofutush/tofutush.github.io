It's been exhausting. I've been going to bed before midnight and sleeping until seven these days; and while that's certainly healthy, it also proves how tired I am.

Good news. The trip was okay. I got here without losing a lot of stuff. (Except that one clothes hanger that broke. IDEK when or where; probably during one of the flights or when I dragged the bag down the conveyor belt?)

I went to a lot of new student events. Everyone is so… energetic here. I mean, they acted that way when I was in elementary school, but I assumed it was because we were kids, so the adults want to appear fun. But now, as college students, they still act like that. All the hype, all the cheering, all the socializing… most of the time it's too loud.

It's Sunday, and finally there is nothing going on. (Actually there is, but I just decided to skip on them.) I'm in the dorm on my computer, my roommate is on her computer; life is perfect like this. I have been experiencing an extreme lack of motivation in doing paracosming, but I've grown to know that certain types of stress can do that. Hopefully when classes start I can settle into a routine I like.

The socializing! Day 234 of dreaming to immigrate to Moreland. It's like the entire world is hostile to introverts and the only way to ever be a part of society is to turn yourself into an extrovert. Why do people like going to lunch / dinner in a huge-ass group anyways? Dining is such a personal thing. I just want to get my food and chew on it alone, no talking. It scares me that I'm bound to have to deal with a lot of people eventually, and even to GO TO other people and TALK to them to try to get them interested in ME. Like what the fuck! How the fuck am I supposed to do that!

Also all the water is freezing cold here. I had to buy a kettle for warmer water. I remember when I was a kid I saw this girl putting a slab of ice in her water bottle, explaining that if she finished drinking, the ice would melt and she would have more water to drink. It sounded so stupid to me, because ice has a lower density than water so she's essentially getting less water in the same-sized bottle. But thinking back, she would probably have less water than have room-temperature water.

Oh, and the irony of having the most free time during the weekends, yet everything is closed. I've yet to open a bank account and mail that package to a friend. Hopefully I can get those done by next week.

Oh, and I've just heard about Blaugust today, as someone posted about it ending. Maybe I can join next year. I have a hard time coming up with things to write about, so hopefully that can be a motivator.
