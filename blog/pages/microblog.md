Blue Prince made me scared of dates and the number 8. Lorelei made me scared of years and the number 4.

That's just great. Now I'm scared of the whole calendar.

I'm already freaked half to death! This isn't even a horror game, just a puzzle game! And a good one at that. I'm definitely writing a blog post when I finish this.

Me: I would finish the animation today!

Also me: slid on the snow, reached a hand out to hold onto a brick wall, successfully prevented myself from falling but cut my hand a tiny bit.

Also me, a spoiled princess: my hand hurts I will not be drawing today.

Y'know, I've always been obsessed with *logical* actions characters take, and focusing on that too much makes me disregard the logical action *characters* take — what's in-character for them to do? Humans don't always take the most logical course of action. In fact, they *rarely* do. I think, in recognizing this, I can hopefully write characters with more personalities; and also make things easier for myself.

For example (this is from *Tadlet Kingdom Adventures* which has been privated for the time being) after Snowy assassinated Cloud and the Hamster police tore off a piece of her cloak, won't she ditch the cloak as soon as possible so she won't get recognized for the tear? But if that's the case, how the gang finds out that Snowy is the assassin would be a lot more convoluted (because I wrote that part not realizing the most logical action is to ditch the cloak). Also, keeping the cloak on signifies that Snowy is a dumbass, too arrogant to think the stupid hamsters would find her, and too confident in the Dog Tadlet Crown would have her back. Or maybe I'm just making excuses, who knows.

Sparky would get paid in Starcorp shares, zero real money. But she sells it all immediately after she gets them.

As much as I hate *Spy School*, the crown still has to go to *Mrs. Smith's Spy School for Girls*. Even *Spy School* can't manage to traumatize me 2 chapters in.

I've grown more emotional as I've grown older, I think? I had watched through a lot of sad stuff as a kid and I never felt a thing, but now reading *Swim Bird*, a children's book inside a video game, drove me nearly to tears.

I suddenly realized, liking digital collecting explains a lot about my feeling of emptiness. It's like I collect my *own* OCs, and my collection is never complete, so I feel agonized over it, but there is no game data file I can rip everything from; I actually have to *create* them myself!

I have all the Blue Prince room thumbnails that I ripped, and the Polytopia assets that the devs had so generously shared on the internet. I used to have them on my old computer too, and now I haven't unzipped this new copy yet LOL. Now that I'm more self-aware about it, what can I collect next?

Pumpkin be like: no one can find holes in a true cover story! Honey a true cover story is not a cover story. It's literally you. He's so not cut out for the secret world. Halcyon made the wrong choice, he wanted a doormat but got a, IDK, squeaky plank on the floor.

Still thinking about how the WIS finds out "Curly" is Pumpkin and how they screw him over.

But on a more positive note, Candlelight Back Home inspiration! So this one is a little interesting. It's based off of a bit of non-TIR-related paracosming I've been doing for a while (the entire plotline is, from its inception). And I've incorporated it into Candlelight's story. Now, I won't ever share this non-TIR-related paracosm with anyone else. But I'm actually sharing its content with you since I literally adapted its plotline here.

To be honest, I'm not really happy that I'm paracosming more about this insane real-life AU than TIR lately. And I get all the stuff I used to get with TIR too, replaying nearly-identical scenes in my head over and over. And I don't like it. Because it's based off of real-life and really, really cringe. But I know I cannot stop the paracosm train, so I just adapt that stuff into TIR.

I need to start writing down reasons why I rejected ideas. Because I keep getting the same ideas again and forgetting why they were scraped the first time I got them.

The Blue Prince House Builder is coming along well! Sometimes, I wonder if anyone is actually going to like these sorts of silly projects. But who cares, if I enjoy the process of making it, and learned from it? But that always brings me to the more difficult question — did I truly learn anything from it? Svelte is still a mess to me, and I'm pretty sure it's horrible practice to pass a function down from `App` into `Directory` and finally into `RoomDir` where it's called. But well, I'm going to invoke sunk cost fallacy and say, I've come so far.

I came up with a media review framework:

- **Did I like it?**
- **Would I read / watch / play it again?**
- **Would I grab a random stranger off the street and make them read / watch / play it?**
- **If someone wants to read / watch / play it, would I throw myself in like a human shield to protect them from harm?**

Cool new idea: Harmony, after getting the mission to collect incriminating evidence on her parents, thought that she would find none, because of course her parents aren't criminals! So she made shit up with the scanty stuff she had on them. And turns out they (at least Frosting) *did* get arrested for that and it broke her heart.

How does it justify her eagerness to join the MSS alongside Sugarcane later though?

Decided to start a microblog! Will post random stuff in here that are too short for posts. Usually I spit them into my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XzdA5vKkb2), but maybe if I spit too much the Social Media Overlords will come after my ass, who knows. It would also be nice to keep an archive of ideas, so it's easier to reference them later!

I foresee my future workflow being still spitting into Discord, but updating this here afterwards if I think it's worth saving.
