title: DNIs aren't THAT useless
---

I am, regrettably, a Toyhouse user. I know, I know, I have sinned, I deserve to die, when I died feed my corpse to the dogs, the dogs don't even want to eat it[^1].

The topic of DNI ("Do Not Interact") lists comes up ever so often, not only on Toyhouse but like in a lot of places on the Internet in general, which makes me feel a lot better. DNIs are a list of boundaries a user sets, and if you feel like you are one of the people they're describing, you should refrain from interacting with them. And many people have said over and over again that DNIs are useless.

I do agree that in general, DNIs are useless in actually preventing people from interacting with you, in the cases when they don't think you'll find out they actually fit your DNI. This is extremely obvious for common DNIs like "racist, misogynist, LGBTQ-phobic" — because no one would actually admit they're one of these people, and since they're so common blocking every one of them would leave you with scarcely any people to interact with.

However, they still hold value as a *signal*. When I say "DNI racist," I'm probably not expecting racists to not come interact; but I am telling anyone who sees this that "I am not racist. I distance myself from them." I don't know about you, but I'd think for someone to put "DNI racist" in their profile, they have a greater chance of not actually being overtly racist.

I don't have a public DNI; I just block whoever I feel like blocking, but I do adhere to the "general DNI" criteria. I've seen some people complain that "general / basic DNI criteria" doesn't mean a thing because it could mean anything, so I promptly blocked them because well, it seems really obvious what it is about. This is the first Google result when you look up "basic DNI": https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/.
