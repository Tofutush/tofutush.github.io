I thought I heard that book 15 was the last book. Apparently either I was wrong or the author wanted to cash back in on this series. But regardless, *Wings of Fire* is getting book 16!

To get ready for that, I've decided to reread all the previous 15 books. Three arcs, 5 each. Because oh let me tell you, these books are *peak*. And I'm reviewing them. Every single one. Including *Legends* and *Winglets*. Because every single one deserves them.

**Spoilers ahead. I will not black anything out.** Damn it's like, really hard to talk about books and stuff without spoiling content you know? But reviews with no spoilers are for people who haven't read these books and you want to introduce it to them. Which is not the purpose of this blog post.

Each of the three arcs contain 5 books that revolve around a prophecy. Each of the 5 books feature a different protagonist, and is solely told from their point of view save for the prologue and epilogue. It also features a guide to the different dragon tribes in the beginning. This looks a lot like the *Warrior Cats* allegiances thing, but it actually serves some really great plot purposes, especially in the first arc.

## Arc 1: The Dragonet Prophecy

### 1. The Dragonet Prophecy (Clay)

I bought this book alone to see if I would like it. I read this, and immediately bought all of the rest (well, up to book 11 because the rest weren't published yet).

You have to understand one thing. Peril was an adult and Clay was a child. I know there are only like a couple years between them but still. This really comes off a lot as the author, despite giving them child ages, also giving them adult-level maturity (and fighting skills, for some).

### 2. The Lost Heir (Tsunami)

### 3. The Hidden Kingdom (Glory)

### 4. The Dark Secret (Starflight)

### 5. The Brightest Night (Sunny)

### Legend 2: Dragonslayer

I put this here because it's related to the first arc despite being the second *Legend*.

## Arc 2: The Jade Mountain Prophecy

### 6. Moon Rising (Moonwatcher)

### 7. Winter Turning (Winter)

### 8. Escaping Peril (Peril)

### 9. Talons of Power (Turtle)

Well, there goes the naming pattern. But I guess "Turtle" isn't a good word to put in any book title.

### 10. Darkness of Dragons (Qibli)

### Legends 1: Darkstalker

## Arc 3: The Lost Continent Prophecy

The "prophecy at the start of a book" structure was really starting to wear off on here, because the prophecy didn't even appear until like book 4.

They pulled out another continent with brand new dragon tribes for this. Everyone does that eventually I suppose, and it's often a trainwreck central, and this arc overall is indeed my least favorite (2 > 1 > 3 IMO), but it does house the book that's the absolute best in the series (and also the worst) and the author only really trainwrecked at the very very end. If arcs 1 and 2 are all peak after peak, this one was quite the roller-coaster.

### 11. The Lost Continent

### 12. The Hive Queen

### 13. The Poison Jungle

### 14. The Dangerous Gift

### 15. The Flames of Hope

## Winglets

Oh my god just because they're little short filler novellas doesn't mean the author just slacked on them. These are all very much peak too.

### Prisoners

### Assassin

### Deserter

### Runaway

## So, arc 4?

I still have high hopes, despite the absolute trainwreck that was book 15. Because this author is clearly very, very good. A couple trainwrecks out of 15+ books isn't that high of an amount. Besides, while all the other books were published within a year of each other, this one had a 4-year gap with book 15. I don't know what she was doing these 4 years, but I hope that means she had time to cook.

Allow me to complain about the comics though. They're fucking ugly. I saw the cover and a couple pages and was like. Wow nah. Also what is it with people always drawing Glory with green scales and orange wings? I don't even recall the author describing her like that even once!
