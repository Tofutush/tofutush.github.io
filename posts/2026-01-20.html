    </ol>
    <p>All the time LOL.</p>
    <ol start="26">
      <li>do you read visual novels?</li>

    <ol start="34">
      <li>can a miracle certainly occur?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Depends on how you define a miracle. Miracles are many factors combining together neatly. If it's purely magical, like &quot;the patient suddenly just got better!&quot; then no, despite being something I may want to see happen.</p>

    <ol start="40">
      <li>are you good at spelling?</li>

    <p>I can't live without a spellchecker.</p>

    <p>Any one of them.</p>
    <ol start="73">
      <li>what did your parents almost name you?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Same pronunciation, but a different character. They named me before I was born and got used to pronunciation, but after I was born their friend said (erroneously) that I lacked fire, so they found a new character with the same pronunciation but with a fire in it.</p>
    <ol start="74">
      <li>what would you want your name to be if you were not your current gender?</li>

    <ol start="77">
      <li>when did you first regularly start going online?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In fifth grade, I think. That was when I got Tiktok (or Douyin if you're insistent on using different names. I don't think the international version was released back then?). Yeah bad times. But coincidentally it was what got me into websites in the first place! Like seriously! I saw some videos that was just someone's computer screen opening up notepad, typing in a bunch of cryptic stuff (literally just HTML and JS) which was too sped-up to copy (and half cut-off at the edge of the screen), to make silly little interactions like &quot;do you love me?&quot; and the &quot;no&quot; button turns into &quot;yes&quot; when you hover it. I was fascinated by that and wanted to learn to make stuff like that myself.</p>
    <p>Tiktok is still hell though; stay away.</p>

      <li>whats the biggest city you've been to?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>According to Wikipedia list of largest cities by population, Shanghai. I hate this fact. Guangzhou is literally just one place behind! Shanghai can go to hell.</p>
