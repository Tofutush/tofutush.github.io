I suddenly realized, liking digital collecting explains a lot about my feeling of emptiness. It's like I collect my *own* OCs, and my collection is never complete, so I feel agonized over it, but there is no game data file I can rip everything from; I actually have to *create* them myself!

I have all the Blue Prince room thumbnails that I ripped, and the Polytopia assets that the publishers had so generously shared on the internet. I used to have them on my old computer too, and now I haven't unzipped this new copy yet LOL. Now that I'm more self-aware about it, what can I collect next?
