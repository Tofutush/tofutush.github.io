    <h1>2025 Recap</h1>
    <p>I used to dislike recaps, thinking that I won't have anything to write about (the same justification I had for not starting a blog, actually). But now that I think about it, its a good way to see how far you've come. So 2025 recap it is.</p>

    <p>18th birthday was quite a disaster. I remember crying on the ride home. Later, though, my parents did apologize for making my birthday about bugging my brother, and offered to make-up by doing something, which I assume they did but I forgot what it was. Bad memories do tend to stick better than nice ones.</p>
    <p>I would've been old enough to drink, too; if only I hadn't almost immediately went to the US where I'm not. Not that I <em>want</em> to drink, but still.</p>
    <h3 id="i-went-to-college" tabindex="-1">I went to college.</h3>
    <p>This is the big one! I went to live on the opposite side of the globe and survived. I finished the first semester of college pretty okay, I guess? It worried me that my least 2 favorite classes were both classes that relate directly to the content of my major. But well.</p>
    <p>I also made a nonzero number of friends in college, something I never thought I'd actually manage to do! It's entirely because a friendly girl pulled a bunch of people together who would otherwise never talk to each other. I also celebrated Christmas with said girl's family and they were a lovely bunch.</p>
    <h3 id="3-websites-reached-1-year-old" tabindex="-1">3 websites reached 1 year old.</h3>
    <p>TIR, this blog, and OC Webring.</p>
    <p>I added a lot of stuff to all three. The house of cards grew taller. Although, I did feel like I wasn't actually improving my webdev skills much.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TIR: Many things!</li>
      <li>OC-Webring: This one hasn't received care in a long while, but on 2025-12-26 I maniacally added pagination and tag browsing, as well as switched from Liquid to Vento.</li>
      <li>Blog: I added tags to it. That's basically it.</li>
      <li>Chinese site: I started a Notion site at first, got tired of it, and made another using Obsidian + Quartz instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="stuff-i-did" tabindex="-1">Stuff I did</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Went to Xinjiang!</li>
      <li>Ditched my 2-year Duolingo French streak for agonizingly self-studying Uyghurche (ياخشىمۇسىز مېنىڭ دوستۇم!).</li>
      <li>Finished <em>The Little Drummer Girl</em>, <em>A Perfect Spy</em>, and <em>The Progress of Things</em> — at least, as far as TPoT's been completed.</li>
      <li>Second year of Artfight. Got a little burnt-out near the end, but overall had a great time. Can't wait for next year's!</li>
      <li>Made my first <a href="https://youtu.be/v4ats5O0mio" class="external-link" target="_blank">PMV</a>!</li>
      <li>Opened a bank account and credit card, with much ordeal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="stuff-i-want-to-do" tabindex="-1">Stuff I want to do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a driver's license. It's going to be a tad convoluted. I'd have to open a proof of SSN ineligibility, and then go get a learner's permit, and only afterwards can I try the actual driver's test. It would only be doable next summer, I'm afraid. But I'm going to change dorm rooms next summer (though it's still in the same building; plus the dorms are closed anyways), and I don't really know how to deal with the address stuff either. But we'll see when we get there! <ul>
          <li>Probably not even next summer LOL but we'll get there</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Keep up with schoolwork!</li>
      <li>Continue paracosming!</li>
      <li>Plan out Family of Secrets better!</li>
      <li>Finish the art assets for Blackjack with Sky!</li>
      <li>Definitely not a 2026 goal, but finish John le Carré's books and write a guide to them!</li>
      <li>Be happy!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="is-tofu-v2025-different-from-tofu-v2024" tabindex="-1">Is Tofu v.2025 different from Tofu v.2024?</h2>
    <p>I can't say. I still feel the same, really. I'd even go as far as to say I'm <em>more</em> confused by uncertainties and <em>less</em> firm in my beliefs. But that's a good sign, isn't it? It's a sign that I'm growing.</p>
    <p>Last year, I celebrated New Year sleeping on the couch in the commie-block. This year, I'm 13 hours behind but would probably do so in a similar fashion, just in an actual bed instead.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This is vastly based off memory, so I may have missed a lot of stuff. But that's a start! Maybe in the future, I can even discipline myself into making monthly recaps. Here's to many more years to come!</p>
