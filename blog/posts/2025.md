I used to dislike recaps, thinking that I won't have anything to write about. But now that I think about it, its a good way to see how far you've come. So 2025 recap it is.

## Milestones

I graduated high school and went to college. I went to live on the opposite side of the globe and my parents didn't come with me.

I finished my first semester of college relatively nicely.

The TIR website reached 1 year old.

## Stuff I did

- Ditched my 2-year Duolingo French streak for agonizingly self-studying Uyghurche (سىلەر مېنىڭ دوستۇملار!).

## Conclusion

This is vastly based off memory, so I may have missed a lot of stuff. But that's a start! Maybe in the future, I can even discipline myself into making monthly recaps. Here's to many more years to come!
