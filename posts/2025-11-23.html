    <h1>Webmaster Questionnaire</h1>
    <p dir="auto">Inspired by <a href="https://zhongvie.bearblog.dev/2025-11-22/" class="external-link" target="_blank" dir="auto">Asuraid</a>!</p>
    <ol dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Please introduce yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Tofutush.</p>
    <ol start="2" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">How long have you been making websites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I… can't remember. For my main TIR site specifically, it's a little more than one year.</p>
    <ol start="3" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">And what got you into the hobby?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Okay this is going to sound really long-winded like everything about me, but hear me out. So I liked Scratch as a kid, alright. And then for some reason I found out about BYOB, which is like another Scratch that let you <strong dir="auto">b</strong>uild <strong dir="auto">y</strong>our <strong dir="auto">o</strong>wn <strong dir="auto">b</strong>locks. And then, I was trying to find this BYOB thing again when I found out that it's changed to SNAP! BYOB, and it's written in JavaScript and open-sourced on Github. So I downloaded the code (without even knowing what Git was; I just downloaded the ZIP file) and played around with it. It's mostly JS (I lied it's <em dir="auto">all</em> JS), so I learned JS, and somehow found Eloquent JavaScript which is a really good book it's online for free. I read the 3rd edition but it has a 4th edition now. I once even emailed the author once asking a really stupid question, and they emailed back answering it, and I still cringe at that. And then if you learned JS, it's only natural that you start making websites. I… I just realized I didn't really answer the question. Sorry.</p>
    <p dir="auto">Oh and there's <a href="https://mspfa.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" dir="auto">MSPFA</a> which, like, allows a lot of HTML stuff and I guess the TIR site started when I tried making a mirror of my comic.</p>
    <ol start="4" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What kind of website are you most interested in?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Personal OC / Worldbuilding sites!</p>
    <ol start="5" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Nah I do the webmaster version of &quot;no beta we die like men.&quot;</p>
    <ol start="6" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Please link to your biggest inspirations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Oh my… here's this question that's always like &quot;I'd have a lot of stuff to say but not off the top of my head.&quot; <a href="https://numbersstory.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" dir="auto">Numbers Story</a> definitely is among the top. And <a href="https://bntarwarn.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" dir="auto">BNT's site</a>. There are many more sites that I love but I discovered them a lot later so they don't really count as inspiration.</p>
    <ol start="7" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What's your favourite part about making websites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Making everything automated LOL, I love it when I just update one thing and multiple things on different parts of the website update accordingly. Like I add an entry to <code>gallery imgs.json</code> and the picture appears in the gallery and character galleries, etc.</p>
    <ol start="8" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">And the thing you struggle with the most?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I think… layouts? Because, well, if you look at all three of my sites, they're all just vertical stuff going downwards LOL. I think the biggest problem was that I just have to make my font gigantic, and that makes columns really hard to do, because there isn't enough space left when the font's that big. And I just suck at design in general. Really scary considering designing is like a part of my major right now LOL I'm so cooked.</p>
    <ol start="9" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Mostly the same. Some have sub-layouts. Like world pages with their categories display and stuff. But the main layout is the same.</p>
    <ol start="10" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">How confident are you with CSS?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Very.</p>
    <ol start="11" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you know how to correctly use <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Whelp, never heard of it. (Actually I heard it when reading Aid's response to this questionnaire but that doesn't count.)</p>
    <ol start="12" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What is your favourite HTML element?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto"><code>&lt;legend&gt;</code>. Girl's a legend.</p>
    <ol start="13" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto"><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>.</p>
    <ol start="14" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you know JavaScript?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yes.</p>
    <ol start="15" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">How about PHP?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">A little.</p>
    <ol start="16" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">For TIR, most things are gray to emphasize the characters' soul colors. This website's color scheme is taken from Cohost.</p>
    <ol start="17" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Are you more focused on content or design?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Content, probably.</p>
    <ol start="18" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">No. I'd like to but I just can't commit. The domain I can purchase right now (<code>tofutush.cn</code>) wouldn't be useful in any professional capacity; what I'd like most is one whose apex domain I can use professionally someday in the future, and I can shove my TIR stuff into subdomains. Plus, I'm not sure whether the cheapest TLD for me (<code>.cn</code>) would be &quot;professional&quot; looking anywhere outside China — or inside China for that matter. Maybe when I'm actually there and less stingy I would buy something.</p>
    <ol start="19" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What do you think of nostalgia-focused or &quot;retro&quot; websites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Eh, I'm not fond of them. They don't bring me any nostalgia because I'm young and had been on the internet for even less time.</p>
    <ol start="20" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">It should be. I don't check but it should be.</p>
    <ol start="21" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I love buttons! Banners not so much, but I love some neat and tidy 88x31 buttons.</p>
    <ol start="22" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What do you think of button walls in particular?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">When they get <em dir="auto">too</em> big without <em dir="auto">some</em> sort of categorizing I feel like they lose their point, but I do own a small button wall.</p>
    <ol start="23" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Very specific answer — I'd use Vento instead of Liquid, and it's going to be <em dir="auto">pretty</em> different in terms of templating but not a whole ton of change in site structure and appearance.</p>
    <ol start="24" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Are you envious of other people's websites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Well yes, sometimes. Especially when they're very full of content (glances at Numbers Story…)</p>
    <ol start="25" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What text editor do you use?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">VS Code.</p>
    <ol start="26" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Why do you use that one?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Atom died and everyone told me to switch to that. There was an Atom plugin that I loved though, it's called Pentagons or something and it literally just puts a bunch of floating pentagons in the background. For a while after the switch, I missed the pentagons so much I couldn't focus on any coding and tried using the dead Atom for a bit before it really became unusable.</p>
    <ol start="27" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">On the server.</p>
    <ol start="28" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I don't care. I still prefer Neocities for the social aspect, and I don't need to fetch anything really.</p>
    <ol start="29" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Neocities tells you that exactly, it's 112.74 MB.</p>
    <ol start="30" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you keep local backups of your files?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Just one copy, which is the cloned Github repo, which doesn't really count as a &quot;backup&quot; LOL.</p>
    <ol start="31" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">It depends on how the webmaster executed it. But I tend to the more simpler side.</p>
    <ol start="32" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Grayscale, because I suck at colors. Other than that, Cohost color scheme. If you really force me to make my own color scheme, I'd go for blues, because I like blue.</p>
    <ol start="33" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">No. Sunk cost fallacy.</p>
    <ol start="34" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Well, if they consider me friends?</p>
    <ol start="35" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do people in your real life know about your website?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yes.</p>
    <ol start="36" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you update your website very often? How often is &quot;very often&quot;?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">It auto-updates every day LOL. But other than that, I do update it quite often, especially when I'm procrastinating on real-life tasks.</p>
    <ol start="37" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">No. Lazy; and aforementioned lack of design skills.</p>
    <ol start="38" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Hobby, I suppose. It's revolved around TIR I mean. This blog is me-focused; it's literally a blog.</p>
    <ol start="39" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you do web design professionally?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">No.</p>
    <ol start="40" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I don't know.</p>
    <ol start="41" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you communicate with people by email very much?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">There's school; and I usually contact the OC Webring people with email if that's what they left as their contact method.</p>
    <ol start="42" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yes.</p>
    <ol start="43" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yes.</p>
    <ol start="44" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yes. Random stuff. Every MLP song. Many Homestuck songs. And — <em dir="auto">sigh</em> — Hazbin Hotel songs. And random stuff I come across that I download and horde in my offline music library 3GB large.</p>
    <ol start="45" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Three. TIR, blog, OC webring. Sometimes I talk about TIR meta on this blog.</p>
    <ol start="46" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Blog covers anything I want to write about.</p>
    <ol start="47" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Refer to <a href="/posts/2025-10-26" dir="auto">this post</a> — I don't know what my real self looks like. But I don't try to construct a persona, so I suppose this is my real self.</p>
    <ol start="48" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Still, it depends on whether they think I'm their friend LOL. It's not like I actively reach out and talk to them. Well.</p>
    <ol start="49" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yes, most of the time.</p>
    <ol start="50" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What are practices that you think people should avoid?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Iframes containing content of the same site (they're for embedding other sites' contents!). Too much client JS. Fancy fonts (but now that I override fonts it doesn't matter that much — except those iframes, ugh!) Using <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code> on literally everything.</p>
    <ol start="51" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto"><a href="/posts/2025-10-07#responsiveness" dir="auto">Fluid typography</a>.</p>
    <ol start="52" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Well, I do use a lot of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s LOL.</p>
    <ol start="53" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you consider different browsers?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Not really, eh.</p>
    <ol start="54" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Chrome. Don't use it. Use Firefox. Thank you.</p>
    <ol start="55" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">And what OS are you on?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Windows 11, ugh.</p>
    <ol start="56" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I just happen to. It sucks. Use Linux. Thank you.</p>
    <ol start="57" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Are your websites mobile-friendly?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yeah!</p>
    <ol start="58" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What are your thoughts on autoplay?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I hate them hate them hate them</p>
    <ol start="59" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I like them! Though I think I'm now in enough of them that I don't actively join more. I also have <a href="https://oc-webring.neocities.org" class="external-link" target="_blank" dir="auto">one</a> myself!</p>
    <ol start="60" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">No.</p>
    <ol start="61" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Are your websites &quot;cliche&quot;, in your opinion?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I don't know? It certainly looks kinda generic and &quot;corporate,&quot; I guess. Refer to my non-existent design skills LOL.</p>
    <ol start="62" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">So full of content. It answers every question you raise. It gets you immersed in my world, turns into a fan of TIR and a fan of me, and eventually you will worship me as your god —</p>
    <ol start="63" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I draw!</p>
    <ol start="64" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What are your favourite resource sites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Eh, I don't really know any.</p>
    <ol start="65" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Itching to change layout, add new stuff, etc; only to give up because of this huge-ass font I'm adamant on not changing and my terrible design skills and my high standards.</p>
    <ol start="66" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Don't be afraid to use templates, don't be afraid to copy code, and utilize the DevTools!</p>
    <ol start="67" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Well, the hard-coded styles are still CSS! But yeah most of them are in CSS files. If there's a small thing I need a style for and I don't want to create a class just for that, I code it into the style property.</p>
    <ol start="68" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">What do you think of frameset layouts?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Archaic.</p>
    <ol start="69" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">How about table-based layouts?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Archaic.</p>
    <ol start="70" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you subscribe to the ideas of &quot;one-column&quot;, &quot;two-column&quot; and &quot;three-column&quot; layouts? Do you use any of these?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Mine is one-column. I don't know how they are &quot;ideas&quot; you &quot;subscribe&quot; to… They're just layouts?</p>
    <ol start="71" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">CSS.</p>
    <ol start="72" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Nah.</p>
    <ol start="73" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Nope.</p>
    <ol start="74" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I'd say somewhere between middle and advanced.</p>
    <ol start="75" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Yes.</p>
    <ol start="76" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">How did YOU learn how to make websites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">I forgot LOL. Refer to question 3.</p>
    <ol start="77" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Maybe that had happened. I don't know.</p>
    <ol start="78" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">Thoughts on floating elements?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Only for images.</p>
    <ol start="79" dir="auto">
      <li dir="auto">When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="auto">Either <code>em</code> or <code>%</code>, depending on situation.</p>
    <ol start="80" dir="auto">
