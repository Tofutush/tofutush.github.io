## Previously…

Funny way how I found out this book existed. I found this game online called [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/) which is basically a country simulator. So I created Bauhinia, or attempted to but the name was fucking taken by some tasteless stranger! But it was going to expire soon, so I made Bauhinia after it did.

And then I got too overwhelmed by stuff that I didn't know what buttons to click, and left it at that. Today, I logged on again, found that Bauhinia was long gone because I hadn't logged in for so long, but I could restore it, so I did.

The Republic of Bauhinia had the flag of Hong Kong because you could only choose from existing flags. It was a "Compulsory Consumerist State," and the blurb quote read, "Hahahahaha." Yeah that was past me's doing. It has good civil rights, very strong economy, and rare political freedom.

Here's the entire profile description. It was so epic I decided to paste the entire thing here.

> The Republic of Bauhinia is a large, efficient nation, renowned for its barren, inhospitable landscape, irreverence towards religion, and complete absence of social welfare. The hard-nosed, hard-working, cynical population of 112 million Bauhinians are rabid consumers, partly through choice and partly because the government tells them to and dissenters tend to vanish from their homes at night.
>
> The minute, well-organized government, or what there is of one, prioritizes Law & Order, although Healthcare, Education, and Defense are also considered important, while Spirituality and International Aid are ignored. Citizens pay a flat income tax of 5.5%.
>
> The very strong Bauhinian economy, worth 8.10 trillion bucks a year, is driven almost entirely by the private sector, which is broadly diversified and led by the Door-to-door Insurance Sales industry, with major contributions from Gambling, Information Technology, and Book Publishing. Average income is 72,331 bucks, but there is a significant disparity between incomes, with the richest 10% of citizens earning 213,170 per year while the poor average 19,312, a ratio of 11.0 to 1.
>
> The mining industry is making inroads into environmentally sensitive areas, organ donation is compulsory, the latest Harry Potter book is a bestseller, and Bauhinian watches are often the only thing to survive a disaster intact. Crime is a problem, with the police force struggling against a lack of funding and a high mortality rate. Bauhinia's national animal is the Puppy, which teeters on the brink of extinction due to widespread deforestation.
>
> Bauhinia is ranked 192,079th in the world and 7,971st in Osiris for Most Advanced Law Enforcement, scoring 1,203.88 on the Orwell Orderliness Index.

Here's the recent events list:

- Seconds ago: Bauhinia  was refounded in Osiris.
- 1 year 70 days ago: Bauhinia  ceased to exist in The West Pacific.
- 1 year 97 days ago: Bauhinia was ranked in the Top 1% of the world for Largest Insurance Industry, the Top 5% for Lowest Overall Tax Burden and Largest Gambling Industry, and the Top 10% for Largest Publishing Industry and Highest Disposable Incomes.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Bauhinia's influence in The West Pacific rose from "Zero" to "Unproven".
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, Bauhinian watches are often the only thing to survive a disaster intact.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, the latest Harry Potter book is a bestseller.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, organ donation is compulsory.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Following new legislation in Bauhinia, the mining industry is making inroads into environmentally sensitive areas.
- 1 year 98 days ago: Bauhinia was founded in The West Pacific.

But alright, none of that was actually on topic. I might log in every year or so just to hog Bauhinia's name though. The thing is, the developer of the game, Max Barry, also wrote books, and they looked quite interesting, so I added them to my booklist where they promptly collected digital dust for about 1 year 90 days. But recently I decided to go ahead with one of them to see: do I let the *other* books continue to collect digital dust, or do I get rid of them?

## The actual review

So I started to read *Jennifer Government*. Its premise is that, this is an ultra-Capitalist USA society, and people take on the last names of their employers. So we have Hack Nike, Billy Bechtel, people like that. Kids are apparently named after the school they attend, like Hayley McDonalds[^1] from a McDonalds-ran school, because all schools were funded by private companies too. Unemployed people, and I assume babies, have no last name. And Jennifer Government, as you can guess, works for the government. And these people get in trouble as their lives intertwine and stuff. It was a solid and promising premise, and what caught my attention in the first place.

I've always thought I wasn't good enough of a writer to review books, but like. I'm doing it because I actually felt like I have something to say. So yeah, I'm saying them. Obviously, **spoiler alert**. There are many things I want to talk about so no blacked-out text this time.

First of all, why are they named Hack and Buy? Who one day had a baby and decided to name him Buy?

Also, the USA now encompasses (at least) the current USA itself, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. In all subsequent instances of "USA" I mean this expanded USA.

Jennifer works for the Australian branch of the Government. Makes sense since the author is Australian. The locations in the book are all super generic. London, Los Angeles, I don't even remember which Australian city they were in… I don't think it would've made a difference if the events happened anywhere else. And well, I suppose if that is the author's intention then it works well to show how assimilated these countries have become[^2], but reading the rest of the book, I was not confident that the author could do any better if that was *not* his intention.

---

Next… alright I admit my issues with this book were too numerous and too scattered to organize but I'll try if you'll bear with me.

The chapters were super short. I don't know whether it's because they're really just short or I just read too much John le Carré, but this, paired with the constant POV switching, made my head a whirlwind. Things barely happen in one chapter before we go to another character, and by the time we loop back I had already forgotten what this character was supposed to be doing.

In addition, Hayley should not have been given any POV chapters if her death is the inciting incident. She narrates two chapters, and the next time she appears she just up and dies. If this was supposed to be a bait-and-switch well then, you got me, because I genuinely thought the author was setting Hayley up for future character development. In her first two appearances, Hayley was giving a speech to her class about how the USA is great and awesome, compared to Europe where they're bad and horrible and have to pay taxes. Her teacher was quite upset about this and challenged her beliefs subtly, but she was firm on her stance. The teacher was sad. Fucker, aren't you her teacher? What have you been teaching her then? Like where do you think Hayley got her beliefs from, if not the teacher? Her parents? I don't think her parents would be that happy with the current state of the world if they're not wealthy enough to throw away a couple thousand bucks for those shoes[^3]. I think the author was trying to show how the system brainwashes children, but… the main vessel for them to do that is through schools and teachers? Having the teacher disagree with her speech completely defeats the purpose.

And well, with this speech scene, I was assuming one day Hayley would have her beliefs challenged. But no. She just dies. Buy, the rich but sad and lonely and "money can't solve problems[^4]" guy, came across her desperately wanting to buy a new pair of shoes that Nike was selling. So he dumps a bunch of money on her thinking he made her day. Before then we saw Hack Nike being told to murder 10 people who buys those shoes so people would think "they're killing people for these shoes!" and it would make the prices go higher. Weird logic but not the weirdest logic this book has to offer. So Hayley got shot because of that, and one kid ran to Buy for help, but emergency lines refused to help unless he could prove he has the ability to pay, and Buy has to contend with his guilt. Later he got so guilty he tried to kill himself. Very unfortunately though, he was too stupid to figure out how to work a gun, and also Jennifer stopped him.

One big problem is… if Buy is so rich, wouldn't he be a member of an emergency service already?

I think it would've worked so much better if it was someone else dying and Hayley ran to Buy for help. Buy still has to watch a kid die, and if Hayley was also distraught at her friend dying that would add more to Buy's guilt. And then Hayley could realize that the system who let her friend die was, maybe, not the perfect thing she thought it was.

In addition, I think Buy's suicide could've been framed so much better as a result of alienation of labor. I really don't know if that was the author's intention and he was just being subtle this time, because the text continuously framed it as a direct result of his guilt over Hayley's death. But the alienation signs were clear. He was sitting at his desk, he could use insider trading to make tons, but he's just sad and depressed. Because he's alienated from his labor.

Everyone in this world is a fucking wacko. It is definitely more the author's writing's fault than the McDonalds education. If I were to write down every instance where the characters were being utterly stupid that would make this review unnecessarily long, so I'll just point out the most egregious instance: John Nike and Billy Bechtel, more famously known as Billy NRA.

One of the backstory reveals was the history between Jennifer and John. Apparently Jennifer got pregnant and John didn't want the kid so they broke up. Fucker, if you didn't want a kid then wear a condom? Neuter yourself? That happened offscreen though so whatever. John was still a wacko. Just what's this guy's deal?

There was this scene which I suppose was supposed to be important in the book. You know those scenes in books where the protagonist gives their theme-stating speech? This one was like that, except it's anti-theme, the opposite of what the author wants to say, what the author is saying to *avoid*. So John had ordered Billy to assassinate the President, though the dumb fucker failed; he then ordered NRA planes to shoot his plane down, which was a success. So now that the President is dead, US Alliance got pretty mad at John for such a reckless act and got him to a meeting where they would vote on whether to kick him out or not. Here, John gives a speech about why getting rid of the Government would be good for business. Without Government regulation, you can do *anything*! Any malpractice, any shady tricks, you can do it all and make more money! The other companies' liaisons heard him and something magical apparently dawned on them. They started talking about all sorts of strategies they can now employ to increase profits for their companies. When the voting came, only four people voted to kick him out. John got to stay.

And my problem[^5] is… isn't this *already* happening? The Government is *already* barely scraping by as the corporations reign supreme? Aren't they *already* not paying taxes and laughing at Europeans who do? Aren't most government regulations *already* gone? What do you mean these US Alliance companies still needed this enlightening talk from John to know this? You're living in that world right now! Your companies probably had been doing all that for decades already! This scene should've happened a long time ago, before anyone came up with the idea to have employees take on their companies' names. That would've made more sense.

Billy… my guy Billy… If this guy had grown half a brain during his arc, then most of it wouldn't have happened. Bro wants to go skiing. It was winter in the US, and people told him that New Zealand had great skiing grounds, so he goes there only to find no snow. (And no man-made snow for skiing either apparently.) So bro goes to a shooting range instead, and got recruited by the NRA for his marksmanship. So he trained with them day after day, until one day bro stumbled into a team who had returned from a mission IIRC and one of their teammates, Bill, was missing. They mistook Billy for Bill and he just went along. And then shit happened and Billy met the actual Bill and decided to go report back to the NRA with him. Jennifer (oh right, he is a Government spy now) was spamming his comms devices trying to contact him and he gave no response because he forgot he had that thing. When he got blown, pure luck made the NRA soldiers accidentally shoot Bill and Billy was spared. He was, however, still blown, and the NRA made him go to London to fight against the Government raids. If I caught a spy and wanted to threaten his life in exchange for a job done, I would not send him to fight against the people he is spying for. But the NRA is stupid and Billy is stupid so it all worked out.

So yeah. That was long. This book so heavily depends on the characters being dumbasses for the plot to work, but that isn't even my biggest gripe is. My biggest problem is how USA-centric it is.

Other parts of the world are hardly mentioned. When they are, it's mostly in the context of how bad they are compared to the USA. mostly Europe — look, they have to pay taxes! How evil! And then you look closely and they're literally just welfare states like y'all aren't that different.

- structure
	- short chapters
		- multiple povs, hayleys potential
	- everyones a wacko & stupif
		- john
		- jennifer
		- billy
		- buy & alienation
	- worldbuilding: role of government
	- ultimate gripe: i dont fucking care about the usa

- short chapters, can be merged
	- weird titles
- hayleys death: unexplored potential, could be someone else, hayley goes to buy for help
- very shallow worldview. just welfare states vs not
- role of government? looks like fbi
	- processing name changes all day
- europe, welfare states?
- killing john and going to violets house? the first place id look
- capitalism bad. thank you. what a bold new radical statement no one had said before.
- Jennifers motivation. revealed later?
- what about the 3rd world. im more interested. like im asking for the book to be something else now, but no, im not interested in the usa, im not interested in the book.
- buy: hayley guilt vs alienation of labor
- i like how johns story and violets story meet at the shell takeover, very my cup of tea and pretty much the standard of ensemble-cast-ish stuff
- extremely stupid violet computer plan
	- youd think theyd brief the police more rather than "throw a freaked-out violet into the computer room and expect her to do magic"
- john wtf why are you sticking your neck out for shell
	- why are nike and pepsi at the takeover in the first place
	- why would john be so worked up over two companies that have nothing to do with him. ok theyre from us alliance and team advantage respectively but like give him a thought process here
		- attacking shell is attacking us alliance, attacking us alliance is attacking nike, attacking nike is attacking ME! like that
		- john isnt the most sane guy in the world but thats still a little past my suspension of disbelief
		- why could he go straight to exxonmobils executive floor. youd think you need to swipe a card to press the button or whatever. in a world where corporations reign supreme youd think the corporations would, be, yknow, a little supreme-reigning, yet they allow random people to crash a car into their hq and ride straight up and kill their ceo

[^1]: Personally, I would off myself if my school uniform had a huge McDonalds logo at the back.
[^2]: There was a statement about how two places are basically the same, but I forgot which character said that. Also, there's not much difference in the anglosphere to begin with anyways.
[^3]: Knowing how wacko everyone else is though, I'm not confident.
[^4]: If you have money and are still sad, then that's just a skill issue.
[^5]: Aside from the fact that a new President would simply take his place when the old one was assassinated.
