<p>Uh to start it off, Counterfeit Monkey is an interactive fiction by Emily Short. It's a great game. I can't finish it without hints but it's a great game.</p>
<p>I've started playing it a second time and hoping I won't need to use as many hints now that I'm more familiar with the format.</p>
<p>I'm definitely gonna write something more than this later. And another one on Spider and Web.</p>

<p>I still need hints.</p>
