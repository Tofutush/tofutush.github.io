Questionnaire from [Stupied](https://stupied.neocities.org/about/listography)!

1. Introduce yourself! What kind of art do you make?

Tofutush here. I draw my OCs.

2. How long have you been making art?

Since, IDK, since I could remember. I drew all over 6th floor's walls when I was little. My parents had to repaint all the walls white when we moved out.

3. How many hours do you spend for each piece?

Usually under an hour, maybe 2 at most. Then I get tired of it.

4. Do you prefer taking your time or do you like to quickly move on to the next thing?

Well, I get tired of a piece easily and want to get it over with LOL.

5. When do you decide a piece is finished?

When all the boxes are checked. Lines, colors, shading, eyebrows(!!), background if I felt like it.

6. What part of the creation process do you enjoy the most?

Coloring! I just fill-bucket them all. Satisfying.

7. What part of the creation process do you dislike the most?

Shading. I never know where to shade.

8. Do you have a designated workstation or do you just work wherever?

I need to have a desk big enough for my laptop and tablet, as well as a plug because the software gets extremely laggy if not plugged in.

9. Do you monetize you work or is it purely a hobby?

Just a hobby. I'd love to make money from it though, but eh, I don't know how and my art isn't very monetizable.

10. Where do you share your work? On social media or a personal websites? Do you keep to yourself and close friends?

On the TIR website. Other places, if I remember (I don't).

11. What's an aspect of your art you enjoy?

IDK… it looks cute?

12. What are things you would like to improve on?

Literally everything? Shading, anatomy…

13. Are you self-taught or had formal education?

Mostly self-taught. Went to art classes all the time, from the kids' ones to the "sit in front of an easel drawing geometric shapes for 4 hours" ones, but I don't think I actually learnt a thing.

14. Do you research about old techniques or stick to newer ones?

I stick to this singular set of techniques I have.

15. What do you value more, experimentation or mastery?

Well, experimentation without at least a little mastery would just be doing random shit. Though doing random shit is fine! I suppose I don't value either.

16. Do you practice drawing from the wrist? What other art techniques to you practice?

I thought drawing from the wrist is the bad practice version? I usually draw with my arm, from the elbow usually, sometimes from the shoulder.

17. How frequently do you do studies?

No.

18. Do you understand color theory? How'd you learn or do you want to?

No. I'd like to learn though, but that may require me to \*gasp* not colorpick soul colors! What a blasphemy! But I guess blending modes can help me. IDK.

19. Favorite color(s)?

Blue!

20. Are there colors you avoid? Do you think ugly colors exists?

Super bright neon stuff. I once had a bright green giraffe plushie which I brought in the car, and it gave me such nausea I threw it away immediately after getting off. Like, that was one of the worst carsickness I had ever experienced.

21. Can you do perspective?

Nope!

22. Do you like doing lineart? How do you go about it?

Kinda! I use Clip Studio Paint's vector brush feature. I can't draw without it these days. It allows you to adjust lines after you drew them, but more importantly to erase an entire line up to where it intersects with another. Super convenient!

23. Do you have multiple unfinished projects? Will you ever get to finishing them?

For singular pieces, I have a couple, but not a lot. I usually finish things in one sitting.

24. How do you start a new piece? Do you have a plan or just figure it along the way?

I have an idea, maybe sketch it on paper and take a picture and then trace that sketch on the computer, or just sketch it on the computer.

Back when I did comics, I always thumbnail it on paper, paste the photo on the computer, and sketch in more detail on there.

25. How do you handle art block?

I just don't draw until I get ideas again.

26. Do you listen to music or watch something while working?

If I remember, I'd open up foobar and put that giant-ass library on random. I don't watch stuff though, because my eyes are on the drawing?

27. When are you most motivated to create? In the morning or evening? Rainy or sunny?

I don't know. Maybe if I observed myself enough I'd find a pattern, but now it just appears random to me.

28. Are your sketchbooks messy or aesthetically pleasing?

Messy. It's just a bunch of random shit.

![](../img/artist%20questionnaire%20sketchbook.png)

Half the things I doodle aren't even my OCs. Just a random generic dog or cat.

29. Do you like showing sketchbooks to others?

No.

30. Do you have any art friends? IRL or online?

I have some IRL. Online, not that much.

31. Do you collaborate frequently with your friends? Is there something you'd like to work on together?

No.

32. Have you created art to gift to others? How do feel about parting away from your work?

Yes. Parting away… in the context of this question, I don't think gift art is parting from your work. It's still your work? But considering this question alone, in a "separate art from the artist" sense, I'd still like credit at least.

33. Have you drawn for someone else? Like commissions or requests? Did you enjoy it?

I did art trades. It's fun; I consider them the same as gift art / fanart — drawing not featuring my characters.

They have minimal differences though I suppose. Trades are less "I drew this because appreciate the original material."

34. How's your posture?

I have scoliosis, take that however you want. The doctor said it's uncurable now that I'm 18, but luckily it won't get worse either so yeah.

35. Have you ever been injured making art?

I don't recall.

36. What's a medium of art you've wanted to try / currently attempting?

Animation. Just traced a caramelldansen template. It was exhausting. Did tweening before too, but could never go beyond simple rotation and movement, ugh.

37. Do you prefer stylized or realistic art?

Stylized. If I want realistic stuff I'd go outside.

38. Do you like hyper-realistic art?

Same as above.

39. Do you like abstract art?

No.

40. How do you feel about fine art?

(No idea what that is) According to Oxford Dictionary, fine art is "creative art, especially visual art whose products are to be appreciated primarily or solely for their imaginative, aesthetic, or intellectual content."

Wouldn't most art be considered fine art then? So I guess I like it.

41. How do you feel about outsider art? Do you think you fall in that category?

(What are all these definitions) "Art produced by untrained people who are not part of the artistic establishment."

I fall under this.

42. Do you follow art trends?

No. I've seen some trends, like the Sienna one recently, and the two people lying on grass one from a while ago. For Sienna, I didn't like the song; and for the grass one I did like the song but I didn't know what characters to put there LOL.

43. Do you think you art is influenced by what's currently popular?

Maybe?

44. Do you compare yourself with others? Does it affect you negatively?

Well yeah, can't help it. Sometimes it affects me negatively.

45. Your controversial art take?

Using the circle tool is fine. I think this really only matters in the *Homestuck* fandom LOL, and I don't really know if this take is controversial or agreed-upon.

46. Art related pet peeves?

Eyes appearing through the hair. And this other one that's oddly specific: it's when the character has bangs covering one eye, and you just don't draw the covered eye even when in that piece the bangs aren't long enough to completely cover it. The character turns into a cyclop then. To illustrate:

![](../img/artist%20questionnaire%20cyclop.png)

47. Who or what are your inspirations?

[TheStarFishFace](https://youtu.be/mTxZ_YYsBJw) single-handedly defined my entire workflow. [LiteralHat](https://literalhat.com) is the GOAT. And who could forget Dav Pilkey? And then there's… *Homestuck*.

48. What's an art piece / artist you wished got more attention?

Check out my mutual [Stardustly](https://tumblr.com/stardustly/)!

49. Have you touch grass recently? Do you go out frequently or do you spend most of your time indoors?

I have mold on my head.

50. Do you create art daily?

No.

51. Do you take breaks from creating? How frequently?

Yes. When I'm not creating I'm taking a break; that's my definition.

52. Do you set deadline for your work?

No. I either complete them in one sitting or never complete them.

53. Do you archive your work? Do you keep old pieces?

I have started doing that with my website, but older ones are lost. I have 5 pieces from 2023 and that's the furthest back. I have tons of comics I drew on notebooks that are just. Gone.

54. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Or are you indifferent by it?

Not really embarrassed by my old work, but embarrassed in the sense that I haven't improved much since 2023.

55. Do you seek out for criticism? How do you handle feedback?

I don't seek them out because I don't think I can handle them well LOL.

56. Are you harsh on your own work? Or do you love your work despite all it's flaws?

I am harsh in the sense that I think a piece is trash, yet lenient in the sense that I don't improve it anyways and just let the trash be trash.

57. Do you get compliments frequently? How do feel about them?

Well maybe it's just the insecurity speaking but every time I do get compliments I think the other person is just being nice. Which, I mean, they *are* nice and they *can* be nice and genuine at the same time, no?

58. How do feel about the rise of generative AI? Do you use it for getting ideas or references?

I actually don't care at all if AI "steals" my art or anything, and that it's over-fearmongered. But I don't use it for graphic-art-related things.

59. How do feel about tracing? What about tracing 3d models to streamline art process?

I just traced an animation template recently LOL. I've never traced 3D models because most of them are more accurate to human anatomy and my brain would explode. Accurate anatomy! Unthinkable!

60. Drop you art resources!

Eh, just CSP and an aliased brush.

61. Do you prefer making fanart or original content?

Original content. My beloved OCs.

62. Do you think original content are more creative than fanart?

No. You can't measure creativity. Though I do die a little when I see people making elaborate AUs and extensive fanworks because at that point you *are* making original content but not labeling it as such!

63. Do you strive for originality?

No.

64. Do you draw from imagination or heavily rely on references?

Imagination. I only reference when I'm like super stuck.

65. Do you think using references is a crutch?

No. Isn't using references like the "better," more "correct" way to draw compared to pulling all them shit from your brain?

66. Do you like to make mood boards or scroll through Pinterest?

No.

67. Does your work have a story behind them or do you just make things that you think look neat?

Well all my OCs have a story (if they're lucky), but most of my art is just random shit instead of lore-related art because the latter usually require scenes and scenes have backgrounds and backgrounds are scary. I never know how to pose them anyways. They live forever in my head but I can't put them down on paper LOL.

68. Do you think art should have a purpose?

No.

69. Favorite aesthetic?

Whatever looks cool to me, but those faux-Soviet (or just genuine-Soviet) stuff always gets me. I once had an idea to make notice signs like "wear your seatbelts!" in Soviet aesthetic posters, but I don't actually know the aesthetic enough to replicate it.

70. Do you have a muse or a theme you fall back to?

I don't know.

71. If you could eat you art, what would it taste like?

Those icing and sprinkles that looks nice but give you stomachaches.

72. If your work suddenly became sentient, would it adore or hate you?

I think it would hate me.

73. Based on previous question, can you win in a fist fight against it?

Nope!

74. Is your art style consistent? Do you prefer making a wide variety of art?

It's pretty consistent. I just draw the same old face over and over.

75. Do you revisit old concepts or sketches? Do you touch em up or leave them as is?

I cannot find my old concepts or sketches.

76. Do you believe in talent or is it all skill?

Skill.

77. What's your favorite thing to draw / make? Do you prefer making living things or still life?

Well, my OCs.

78. Do you create your art with a specific audience in mind? Who?

Myself.

79. How do you feel about people taking inspiration from work? Do you think art style theft is real?

I'd be honored, but at the same time I need to yell at them to find someone better. Art style is not a thing so you can't steal something that doesn't exist.

80. Do you participate in art conventions? Do you sell your work or support everyone else?

No, no, and no.

81. Are you art materials expensive? Do you hoard any tools?

Well I guess a laptop plus a tablet is expensive, but they're not one-time-use.

82. Do you organize you supplies and tools systematically?

Nope!

83. Do you clean up after a project? Or do you just leave everything lying around till you need the space?

I tuck my tablet back in the drawer.

84. Do you have a ritual before you start creating? Do you have a drink or some snacks?

No.

85. How do feel about censorship in art? Where do you draw the line for inappropriate art?

The line lies in whatever makes me feel uncomfortable personally. And it shifts with my mood. This is why I deserve to be the dictator of the world, I tell you.

86. Do you censor your own art? Do you feel like you leave out details for it be socially accepted?

Same as above, just whatever makes me uncomfortable. For example, I never draw boobs bigger than a little bump, though I just *know* that Goose *definitely* has the biggest boobs you will ever see… I still draw her completely flat.

87. Do you feel intimated with starting a new projects?

If it's big, like animation, maybe a little.

88. Are you scared of your art regressing? Do you think it's even possible to get worst at art?

Yes. I think it's possible, because art is a skill, like a muscle you need to flex.

89. Do you frequently make compromises for your work? Does your art come out the way you envision them?

Yes, all the time. A piece is nearly never the way I imagine it.

90. How well do you manage your mistakes? Do you stress about them?

If they're for the "important" works, like the thumbnails, profiles, and references, I'd go and fix. Otherwise, depends on my mood.

91. Do you make lists of things you'd like to make? Do you actual commit to them?

I used to, but now I stopped because I never commit LOL.

92. What is your ultimate goal of your work? Like, is to tell a story, connect with others, or just to enjoy the process?

Tell a story, definitely. My OCs deserve the light of day.

93. What's something you've recently worked on that you're really proud of?

The caramelldansen animation! Even though it's just template tracing LOL.

94. Do you have any dream projects? Have you started on them?

The Hillslope comic used to be one. Other than that, they're not that art-related but I have a couple of visual novel ideas. I'm still working on the outline for *Tadlet Kingdom Adventures*.

95. Would you prefer unlimited money or unlimited time to make your projects?

Well, do I have to spend the unlimited money on projects or can I buy other things with it? Because if that's the case, unlimited money can basically buy unlimited time. I'd go live somewhere I like, hire a cook and stuff like that, and never leave the house again. And commission a game studio!

But unlimited time could potentially also generate unlimited money. I'd brand myself as the Immortal Person and charge people a shitton to interview me.

Ultimately though, projects take more time to make. Especially with my current setup, my projects never incur explicit costs. All I need is time.

96. Why do you create art?

Why not?

97. Are you happy with what you create?

Maybe not 100%, but yeah.

98. Do you think everyone should make art?

Yes. I get sad when people want to draw but get scared because they think the result won't be what they expected…

99. What's advice you'd give to newer artist?

Just draw! It *will* be shit, but just draw!

100. When did you finish this? How'd you feel?

16:23. I don't remember when I started so that's useless.
