I finished [*Lorelei and the Laser Eyes*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/). It was a great game! In 11 hours and 12 minutes, I reached 95.9% completion and earned 64 dollars. Suffice to say I still don't really have a good idea of what was going on.

I only found this game because of a video titled something like "Lorelei Is Just Like Blue Prince But Better!" And after playing, I agree with the video! However, this also guarantees constant comparisons to *Blue Prince* in this post.

Basically, the point of the video was to say *Lorelei* features a bunch of puzzles too, but unlike *Blue Prince*, it puts the randomization in the right places. The puzzle solutions are randomized. So if you want to consult a guide, which I relied on, no one can tell you *what* exactly the solution is, only *how* to solve it.
