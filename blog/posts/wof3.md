Part 3 of my review of the entire Wings of Fire series. Same rules apply, **spoilers ahead**!

The "prophecy at the start of a book" structure was really starting to wear off on here, because the prophecy didn't even appear until like book 4.

They pulled out another continent with brand new dragon tribes for this. Everyone does that eventually I suppose, and it's often a trainwreck central, and this arc overall is indeed my least favorite (2 > 1 > 3 IMO), but it does house the book that's the absolute best in the series (and also the worst) and the author only really trainwrecked at the very very end. If arcs 1 and 2 are all peak after peak, this one was quite the roller-coaster.

I personally related to the ranking wall a heck ton for obvious reasons. But as soon as it appeared, I had problems with the logistics.

How many dragons are in the Ice Kingdom? They can't be as tiny as the RainWings and NightWings; that's for sure. They have the core royalty and little nobles and pheasants and all that. Let's say their population is 1 million. That's really small already, for a human country on Earth. If each dragon's name slot is $10cm$ wide and $5cm$ tall, that brings the entire size of the wall to $5,000m^2$. Good luck finding your name on there! Suppose the wall is exactly 1000 names wide and tall; that makes it $50m$ tall and twice as wide. According to Fandom user [Zijayel93](https://wingsoffire.fandom.com/wiki/User:Zijayel93), a dragon is about $5m$ tall and 12m long. The wall is 10 dragons tall and 8 dragons wide.
