title: A Way-Too-Late Silkworm Diary
---

In third grade we all had to keep a box of silkworms for Science class.

We'd buy it at those small stores they like to open near schools, selling drinks, snacks, ice cream, and of course silkworm boxes. Now that I think about it, how did the baby worms survive the shelf? But anyways, when you buy them they're just tiny, ugly babies, shorter than the horizontal length of my fingernail (as of right now), looking like fried maggots. Most of these stores are removed now because parents don't like their kids eating junk food. I wonder how they get their worms now. Over the internet?
