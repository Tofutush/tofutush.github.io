I thought I heard that book 15 was the last book. Apparently either I was wrong or the author wanted to cash back in on this series. But regardless, *Wings of Fire* is getting book 16!

To get ready for that, I've decided to reread all the previous 15 books. Three arcs, 5 each. Because oh let me tell you, these books are *peak*. And I'm reviewing them. Every single one. Including *Legends* and *Winglets*. Because every single one deserves them.

**Spoilers ahead. I will not black anything out.** Damn it's like, really hard to talk about books and stuff without spoiling content you know? But reviews with no spoilers are for people who haven't read these books and you want to introduce it to them. Which is not the purpose of this blog post.[^1]

Each of the three arcs contain 5 books that revolve around a prophecy. Each of the 5 books feature a different protagonist, and is solely told from their point of view save for the prologue and epilogue. It also features a guide to the different dragon tribes in the beginning. This looks a lot like the *Warrior Cats* allegiances thing, but it actually serves some really great plot purposes, especially in the first arc.

## 1. The Dragonet Prophecy (Clay)

I bought this book alone to see if I would like it. I read this, and immediately bought all of the rest (well, up to book 11 because the rest weren't published yet).

This book does a spectacular job of introducing the readers to the world. Because if you think about it more carefully, there is no reason that the dragonets believe what they believe in. If they're all literally raised under a rock, why would they even assume that they have parents and families? Sure, the guardians all came from tribes where families are a thing. But I can't see them teaching the dragonets that. They might as well tell them that their eggs just magically popped up in the world, waiting for the Talons of Peace to find them and hatch them. And for many of the dragon thing, like the MudWing sibling groups, normal dragons should be aware of it since birth. Because even for MudWings who hatched normally and *not* in a cave, who is going to teach the them that they're supposed to stick together and call each other their sibs?

Well! That's because the author needs to give the dragonets a human worldview. They share a worldview with the readers. That's why the dragonets assume they have families and parents, because we humans do and the human readers know that. That's why they don't know anything about dragon society. Anything that they know and we don't is given to us at the beginning — the *NightWing's Guide to the Dragons of Pyrrhia*, and the Pyrrhia map. We are exploring the dragon world *with* the dragonets. And that is what makes the introduction of the dragon world work so smoothly, and the reveals so well. We, as readers, start out knowing just as much as the dragonets. The little stretch in giving the dragonets human worldviews that they shouldn't have is worthwhile to make the introduction of this world so smooth.

Also, for the scavengers featured in Scarlet's palace… when I read *Dragonslayer* for the first time I thought the author was just really good at weaving stories together. But now, reading *The Dragonet Prophecy* again, the actions described were all too insanely detailed that I'm *certain* that the author had the scavengers' story in Scarlet's palace all planned out when writing this book. But there are 8 years between the publishing of these two books… she really just hold her breath for that long??

The setup for this book is also great. You make a premise, five dragonets ending the war. That is a story of what we're expecting. And you immediately break that by first having the SkyWing egg destroyed and replaced by a RainWing, and then it was broken *again* as the dragonets escape prematurely after the inciting incident. The story, then, rather than about the dragonets stopping the war like prophesized, has additional stakes of how they are gonna do that despite the odds.

Clay's personal arc is great. One good thing about all these books is that they always manage to develop characters alongside the plot. Characters actually drive the plot here, but there are still a significant amount of external events that they react to. It's like the perfect blend of character-driven and plot-driven. Clay goes through a general arc of thinking he needs to be violent and find the monster inside him that drove him to attack the other eggs at hatching. But in the end we learn from the MudWings that it was a normal thing for MudWings to do — Clay was helping his hatching get out. And the book ends on him learning to be kind — or rather embracing the kind side of him after being told for his whole life that he's a violent monster — in a world full of violence.

I loved the scene where he played the tune of *The Dragonets Are Coming* and all the prisoners sang with them. That was great.

## 2. The Lost Heir (Tsunami)

Tsunami was a bit of an ass in this book, but because that's what her character development is going against, and also can you blame her? In this book we see her going into the SeaWing Kingdom obsessed with her status as a princess and having dreams of queenhood. She grew from viewing her little sister as a competitor to viewing her as a friend, and even going to protect the egg — another future competitor, because at that point she had already abandoned the idea of becoming the queen, after seeing the shitfuckery of the Council and how royalty act or is supposed to act, and realizing she belongs with her friends and not the SeaWing Kingdom.

Also, I love how they showed the consequences of the dragonets' actions in Scarlet's arena. Even though they're forced to compete, they did still kill dragons, and that thing was not just tossed away in future books. Like in this one… well if you read it you would know what I'm talking about, but a spoiler just in case: !!Tsunami killer her own father!!. But still, it had not been brought up later. It could've been more impactful on Tsunami as a whole is all I'm saying.

Whirlpool and Moray's ass-kissing is pretty funny though, if only reality weren't more exaggerated than fiction.

Also, not to dick-ride Whirlpool, but his teaching method legit works better than Riptide's. It's really hard to learn a language with Riptide's Duolingo-style teaching; it takes a ton of time and dedication. But Whirlpool immerses Tsunami in the language by reading her the entire book (Coral's writing may not be the best in the world but she must have great editors). The best option is to stick Tsunami in the Deep Palace and not allow her to surface. In a couple years, she'd be speaking Aquatic like a native. But well evidently she doesn't have time for that, but maybe one day she will.

Speaking of Aquatic, why *didn't* Webs teach her that? Surely she cannot communicate with other dragons under the cave since there are none, and another language is a handy tool to have, especially as it's essential for underwater communication. This is one of the minor plot points sacrificed for the plot, but honestly I'm fine with that. And maybe a lot of people who speaks English better than their family's language can relate a lot.

## 3. The Hidden Kingdom (Glory)

Really good. Great.

I've seen some people complain how Glory becoming the queen of the RainWings is too Mary-Sue-y or whatever,[^2] but I don't think that at all. Quite the opposite, in fact; Glory's queenhood isn't just natural progression; it's also everything the book and her arc thus far was building towards.

You see, Glory grew up being told RainWings are lazy and useless and good-for-nothing. When they went to the rainforest, she was eager in meeting them, hoping that they would *not* be everything she was told — only to find that they were kind of true. The RainWings were *indeed* so lazy they don't even notice their villagers going missing.[^3] This gave Glory a lot of conflict over her feelings towards her tribe. She *wants* to be proud of them, because she is one of them, but how could she, when they act like *this*?

*This* is why she challenged Magnificent to be queen. If the ones in power isn't willing to do anything, the only way she can enact change is to take the power. Glory challenging Magnificent for the throne is easily one of the best scenes in this arc, as well as the highlight of Glory's arc.

Glory being related to Grandeur, though, was definitely a deux ex machina and it even washes down the weight of her crown, because she doesn't need royal heritage for her rule to be legitimate, and making her royalty erases that message. But the same message is presented in Oasis and Thorn so fine I guess. Also, I don't like how the book frames Grandeur as some nice, upright queen or whatever, even if it's just for a little, because like you're the one who *started* this rotating queen mess ma'am! Stop blaming it all on your daughters!

Also Scarlet's arena is still haunting them in the scene where Glory disguised herself as an IceWing.

## 4. The Dark Secret (Starflight)

Had I ever mentioned that the POV arrangement is perfect for each character to get their own spotlight while at the same time progressing the main overarching plot? One of my favorite things about this series is how the character development ties into the main plot and both progress and develop each other. Or maybe I just read too many horrible books (and shows (looking at you *Hazbin Hotel*)) where the characters act completely stupid and out-of-character in service of the plot. But anyways now we get on the NightWing island with Starflight.

Though we do get a lot of crucial main plot info from this book, I don't think the character development was that good. Starflight spends half the book whining over Sunny, which is horrible enough on its own without whatever the fuck is going on with him and Fatespeaker. The "highlight" for him would probably only be near the end where he made a decision to let Glory go back while he went on gathering the NightWings.

The peak here was how queen Battlewinner died crouching in front of Glory, as if she was bowing to her. That was easily the peakest moment in the arc. Glory becoming queen of the NightWings is also some really warranted plot point, regardless of how "overpowered" Glory might seem, especially since she just became the RainWing queen last book. It's more about the NightWings, how they always reinforced their image of superiority to both other tribes and themselves, now being forced to bow to a dragon they considered inferior to them in every way. And I'm not sugarcoating Glory just because I like her; I don't even like her that much (Sunny > Clay > Glory > Starflight > Tsunami since no one asked), but her path to power is paved so naturally and meaningfully that you can all but root for her.

This book is also the most we get out of the alternate dragonets. And well, I do have a problem here. Why were they horrible to each other while the real dragonets were super good friends? What made them different? Was it *just* because Clay was a bigwings? I don't think that's enough of a reason, plus we don't know if Ochre was a bigwings or not. I know the alternates were pretty much just foils but they're a little too one-dimensional. If they just hate each other for no reason, then the real dragonets love each other for no reason as well.

Also, maybe I'm really just aroace, but every single instance of romance in this series is downright horrible. Clay and Peril was just Peril being a yandere; Tsunami and Riptide was just because everyone else was so wacko that Riptide seemed like the most reasonable option; Glory and Deathbringer was… was some sort of love-on-first-sight-on-the-opposite-ends-of-the-battlefield or some shit;[^4] and Starflight and Sunny was also just stupid stupid. Also the first three are all adult-child in this arc. I won't comment further because well, if other people liked them then other people were probably more normal than I am. (I'm not done though! There is more romance in future books to shit on!)

## 5. The Brightest Night (Sunny)

Maybe some would argue that some random SandWing that just appeared in the last book becoming queen is too much of a stretch, just as how Glory becoming the queen of both RainWings and NightWings is a stretch. But well, even if Thorn only appeared in the last book, she appeared quite early into the book itself. Also, starting from the moment we met Blaze in book 3 (or from the very very start if you Know Your Tropes) it is extremely obvious that none of the three princesses would be queen.

## Legend 2: Dragonslayer

I put this here because it's related to the first arc despite being the second *Legend*.

[^1]: I feel like the only two kinds of book reviews I do are either bashing on the book or praising the book to heaven and either way it involves talking about everything in it.
[^2]: The curse of writing a book too good and writing it too well for the target audience?
[^3]: Note the population differences between the tribes. Most other tribes have settlements and cities and all, and you won't know everyone from your tribe just as in a normal country. But the entire RainWing Kingdom is just one village where everyone knew each other.
[^4]: I almost compared them to Zoe and Svetlana, but comparing an element of your book to an element in a Stuart Gibbs book must be one of the worst things I can do and I can't do it to a series I love.
