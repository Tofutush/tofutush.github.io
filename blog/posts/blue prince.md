**(Slight spoilers for Blue Prince ahead! I'm trying out some spoiler code though so hopefully you'll see blacked out text.)**

A friend recommended me the game [Blue Prince](https://www.blueprincegame.com/) during the summer, and of course I had to try it. After like 10 minutes in, I was horrified. Like what the fuck.

Next time I met the friend, I simply said, "this game, this *game*," over and over while shaking my head.

I never got past rank 5. I also, in my 9-day run, *never* drew any of the key rooms you need to open the Antechamber, like the !!Foundation!!, or the !!Greenhouse!!
