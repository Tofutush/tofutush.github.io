## Travel

List of travel destinations that I have gone to, or want to go! Listed in no particular order; wishlisted for no particular reason other than a simple desire to just *go*.

It would be a long while before I'd actually get to travel anywhere but well, it's good to have one of these stuff here.

Legend

- ~~means have went~~
- means want to go

- China
	- ~~Shenzhen~~: I live here. (Not anymore.) 0/10 don't recommend. Rains whenever you want to go out and the sun comes out only when you're at home. Humidity can reach 90%. Home to the worst high school in all of human existence.
	- ~~Hong Kong~~: Never really as a tourist, just there to do stuff like get vaccines
	- ~~Hunan~~: Never really as a tourist, just there to visit my dad's hometown. 0/10 new years suck and nothing is ever not spicy and they never give red packets more than 500 yuan so what's the point
	- ~~Hebei~~: Never really as a tourist, just there to visit my mom's hometown. 10/10 my aunts make great food
	- Yunnan
		- ~~Kunming~~
		- ~~Dali~~
		- Lijiang
		- Shangri-la
	- Xinjiang (11/10 if you ignore the aridness and the bugs and the horse poop)
		- ~~North~~
			- ~~Urumqi~~
			- ~~Altay~~
			- ~~Ili~~
		- South
			- Kashgar
			- Aksu
			- Hotan
	- Inner Mongolia
	- Tibet (better before I get old)
	- Qinghai
- ~~United States~~
	- ~~The west coast, mostly.~~
- Mongolia
	- Ulaanbaatar
	- Anywhere that's far away from Ulaanbaatar
- Uzbekistan
- North Korea (no I'm not joking)
- Mexico
- Cuba

## Languages

I have a bad habit of wanting to learn any language I come across, despite obviously not having the actual mental capacity for that.

Some languages have their language name written in that language which is a tiny indicator of how much I know said language.

- Uyghurche ۇيغۇرچە (current)
- Ozbekcha
- French Français (ditched for now)
- Latvian
- Russian
- Yi ꆈꌠꁱꂷ
