<h1>I'm departing for the US</h1>
<p>It wasn't until when I was buying plane tickets and changing the default &quot;round-trip&quot; to &quot;one-way,&quot; that it occurred to me: I was leaving for good. It would be four whole years before I'd get back again. (Unless I graduate early LMAO.)</p>
<p>To the United States, where people eat broccoli raw (and complain that it tastes bad) and pack peas inside bags to put on their forehead when they have a fever.</p>
<p>This is pretty much the first time I've traveled alone so far away. I'm ready to make a Twilight Sparkle-style checklist of all the things I need to do. How do I find my transfer plane? Or which conveyor belt my luggage went to? How to check them in again at San Francisco? What if I fuck up and got stranded in, IDK, Detroit?? What if they send me back at the customs? What if I ran into an emergency and had to call my parents but they're asleep and didn't answer?</p>
<p>I'd much rather cuddle in my mom's lap forever but I know that one day I'm going to have to live without them, whether because I've grown up or we're separated by another kind of one-way ticket. I'd much rather go through the former first. At least I can call them and message them, and they can come over during the summer. They even had instructions for me to rent a small place with one bedroom so they can sleep in the bedroom while I can fuck off on the sofa or something, provided that there <em>is</em> a sofa. I need to rent a place regardless; the dorms close during the holidays. Like c'mon, why? My parents aren't letting me go back during the summer either, because &quot;all they do is lie in their beds and waste their lives when they could've been doing internships or taking courses.&quot;</p>
<p>But like, who doesn't want to lie in her bed all day?</p>
