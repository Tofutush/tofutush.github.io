		<h1>I used to like dogs but now I like cats more</h1>

<p>When I was little I was a huge dog person. I drew puppies all the time and could name breeds at a glance. I dreamed of keeping a husky.</p>
<p>But if you ask me now, I would say I'm a cat person. Not that I <em>don't</em> like dogs anymore; I just like cats more now. I could pretty clearly explain the reasons why.</p>
<p>First, back then, I didn't like cats because I knew nothing about them. All my attention was on dogs that I never knew there were different breeds and colors to cats too.</p>
<p><em>Warrior Cats</em> was the turning point for me. I didn't want to read it at first because it's about <em>cats</em> and that's <em>boring come on</em> but when I started reading it, I fell in love with it. I started to draw the characters, make cat OCs, and slowly started to like cats more.</p>
<p>And then there's actually getting to know the real animals, rather than imaginary characters and pictures. Cat fur feels so soft and comfortable, and they clean themselves regularly. Dog fur, on the other handâ€¦ maybe I just haven't pet a Samoyed or something but all the dogs I've pet have hard fur that felt like plastic wires. Golden retrievers, Labradors, poodles, and a couple of Tibetan Terriers once. They are not fun to touch, and they move around too often; too energetic.</p>
<p>Also my mom got a cat a couple of years back and she is adorable. Her name is Sandstorm. I love her.</p>
<p>Recently my aunt got a poodle and we would walk it for her when she didn't have time. Her name was May and she was really, really energetic, and I couldn't bring myself to love her like I do Sandstorm. Her fur is hard; that puffy part on her head didn't feel any good either since all I can really feel was the hard skull. And she was friendly, <em>way too</em> friendly. She would jump onto our legs, which hurt, and lick my mom's mouth, which she hated. She would tug on her leash so hard I had to run to catch up. She was pretty fundamentally incompatible with my personality.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is why I like cats more now. I want a Maine Coon so bad.</p>
