title: Chinese Chemistry
---

I have a lot to yap about how learning Chemistry in Chinese is just. A lot better than English. It makes a lot of things more intuitive and therefore the entire subject easier.

I started Chemistry in ninth grade when the entire thing was taught in Chinese. When I went to high school, I took an Honors Chemistry course that was still mostly in Chinese but the teacher also made us know all the English to prepare for AP Chemistry. (I never took AP Chem. I did CCC and got silver. Fuck them.) And that was when the contrast became really clear to me.

If I spoke fluent Latin, I suppose I would've found English Chemistry easy too? But I don't speak Latin so I can't know.

Starting from the periodic table of elements. With Chinese, not only is every character one character and therefore one syllable, but also the characters are designed so you can know some things about the element just by looking at the character. For example:

- Every element that has 钅 on the left is a metal. (With the "exception" of 金 (gold), which is literally just 钅; and another actual exception of 汞 (mercury), which I'll talk about below.) All the others are non-metals.
- Every element that has 气 on the top is a gas at room temperature. Like 氢 (hydrogen), 氧 (oxygen), and every noble gas.
- Every element with 石 on the left is a solid at room temperature. Like 硅 (Silicon).
- Two elements are liquids in room temperature. The non-metal 溴 (bromine), and the metal 汞 (mercury).

Other than the "type indicator" part, the other part of the character indicates pronunciation, so it's easy to pronounce it immediately. For example, 硒, the non-metal that's solid at room temperature, is pronounced the same as 西 (xī) (without the 石), despite looking a lot like 晒 (shài) which made a lot of people pronounce it wrong, LMAO.

If I remember correctly the chemists are also the only people with that special privilege to make new characters in the modern day. Like actually get them onto the dictionary and all that, for every new element discovered. But in the meantime I wonder what's the point of making all these new elements when none of them are going to exist for more than a millisecond or something like that. But whatever.

Then comes the inorganic compounds. None of those stupidly confusing number suffixes (monoxide vs. dioxide… why not *bi*oxide?) because the numbers are literally one, two, three, etc.. To name a compound, simply take its chemical formula and read it backwards. For example, carbon monoxide ($CO$) would be "one oxygen compounded with carbon" (一氧化碳), and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) would be "two oxygen compounded with carbon" (二氧化碳). There are, of course, exceptions[^1], like hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) being "too much oxygen compounded with hydrogen" (过氧化氢). Salts are named similarly.

[^1]: As the saying goes, the only thing that's without exception is the fact that there will be exceptions.
